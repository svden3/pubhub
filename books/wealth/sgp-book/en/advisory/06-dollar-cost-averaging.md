# Chapter 6: Buy Regularly, Don't Time the Market

## The Story

In 2000, I had just arrived in Silicon Valley.

The airport bus driver said he had just sold his house and put everything into internet stocks.

"Pets.com is going to the moon!"

He timed the market. He chose the highest point.

That April, the NASDAQ started falling. It dropped 80%.

The driver lost everything.

What if he had done it differently?

Not all in at once, but a little every month:

| Month | NASDAQ | Amount Invested | Shares Bought |
|-------|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Jan | 5,000 | $1,000 | 0.20 |
| Apr | 4,000 | $1,000 | 0.25 |
| Jul | 3,000 | $1,000 | 0.33 |
| Oct | 2,000 | $1,000 | 0.50 |

**The more it drops, the more the same money buys.**

This is called **Dollar Cost Averaging** (DCA).

## The Rules

### Rule 1: Don't Try to Time the Market

No one knows if the market will go up or down tomorrow.

Experts don't know.
Fund managers don't know.
You don't know.

So don't guess.

### Rule 2: Fixed Schedule, Fixed Amount

Every month on a fixed date, a fixed amount, automatically invested.

- Buy on payday
- Regardless of market conditions
- Don't watch the news
- Don't think

**Give decision-making power to the system, not your emotions.**

### Rule 3: Lump Sum vs. DCA

If you have a large sum (say $100,000):

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Lump sum | Statistically higher returns | Might buy at the peak |
| 12-month DCA | Less psychological pressure | Might miss gains |

**For beginners: Use 12-month DCA.**

Once you're comfortable with market volatility, consider lump sum.

| **Sun Tzu** | "Water shapes its course according to the ground; an army shapes its victory according to the enemy" — Markets are unpredictable, so don't predict, just DCA |
| **Graham** | "In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine" — Time will prove value |
