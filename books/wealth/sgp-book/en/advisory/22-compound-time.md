# Chapter 22: Compound Interest Needs Time

> "Mama said: Slow and steady wins the race."

## The Story

In 2008, I invested $150,000 in index funds.

In 2009, it dropped to $80,000.

In 2024, it became over $600,000.

**16 years. 4x.**

What did I do in between?

**Nothing.**

Buy. Hold. Wait.

That's compound interest.

## The Math of Compound Interest

### Simple Version

Assuming 10% annual return:

| Years | $10,000 Becomes |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1 year | $11,000 |
| 5 years | $16,105 |
| 10 years | $25,937 |
| 20 years | $67,275 |
| 30 years | $174,494 |
| 40 years | $452,593 |

**The last 10 years earn more than the first 30 years combined.**

This is why time matters so much.

### The Rule of 72

Want to know how many years to double your money?

**72 ÷ Annual return = Years to double**

| Annual Return | Years to Double |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 6% | 12 years |
| 8% | 9 years |
| 10% | 7.2 years |
| 12% | 6 years |

## Time vs Amount

### The Question

Who ends up with more money?

| Person | Start Age | Monthly Investment | Years Investing | At Age 60 |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| A | 25 | $500 | 35 years | $1,150,000 |
| B | 35 | $1,000 | 25 years | $790,000 |

**A invests only half as much monthly, but ends up with $360,000 more.**

**Because A started 10 years earlier.**

### The Lesson

- Starting beats amount
- 10 years early > double the investment
- The best time to invest was 10 years ago. The second best is now.

## Enemies of Compound Interest

### Enemy 1: Interruption

Stopping DCA, even for a few years, causes massive losses.

| Situation | At Age 60 |
|-----------|-----------|
| Start at 25, no interruption | $1,150,000 |
| Start at 25, stop for 5 years (35-40) | $750,000 |

**Lost $400,000.**

### Enemy 2: Market Timing

Trying to "buy low, sell high" means missing the best days.

| Situation | 20-Year Return |
|-----------|----------------|
| Stayed invested | $64,000 → $400,000 |
| Missed the best 10 days | $64,000 → $200,000 |
| Missed the best 20 days | $64,000 → $130,000 |

**Missing 20 days, returns drop 68%.**

### Enemy 3: High Fees

1% fee difference, 30% less returns after 30 years.

| Fee | $100,000 After 30 Years |
|-----|-------------------------|
| 0.1% | $574,000 |
| 1.0% | $432,000 |
| Difference | $142,000 |

**Choose low-fee funds.**

## How to Harness Compound Interest

### Rule 1: Start Early

Don't wait until you "have money to invest."

**Start today. Even $100/month.**

### Rule 2: Never Interrupt

Automate your investments.

Payday → Auto-transfer → Auto-buy

**Take decision-making power away from yourself.**

### Rule 3: Never Sell

Unless you need the money, don't sell.

**Every sale interrupts compounding.**

### Rule 4: Low Fees

Choose index funds with fees < 0.1%.

**Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab.**
