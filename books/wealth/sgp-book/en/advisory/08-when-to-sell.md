# Chapter 8: When to Exit

> "Sarah said: Regret is the investor's worst enemy. Once you decide, don't look back."

## The Story

In 2004, Sarah left our small company for Google.

She gave me an opportunity: "Jim, do you want to come too?"

I didn't go.

After Google went public, Sarah's options were worth millions.

That night, I called Sarah.

"I regret it."

"**Regret is the investor's worst enemy. Once you decide, don't look back.**"

"Who said that?"

"My dad. He said it after losing a lot of money in stocks."

## The Rules

### Rule 1: The Three Reasons to Sell

| Situation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **You need the money** | Buying a house, retirement, emergency |
| **The investment thesis changed** | Company fundamentals deteriorated, industry disappeared |
| **There's a better option** | Higher opportunity cost |

### Rule 2: When NOT to Sell

| Situation | Why You Shouldn't Sell |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Price dropped | Could just be emotional fluctuation |
| News says crash is coming | News is usually behind |
| It's up a lot and you want to lock in gains | You'll miss more upside |
| Friends are all selling | The crowd isn't always right |

### Rule 3: Don't Look Back After Deciding

After selling:
- Don't check how much it went up later
- Don't calculate "what if I hadn't sold"
- Don't regret

**The money is no longer yours. Look forward.**

## Pre-Sell Checklist

Before selling, ask yourself:

1. **Why did I buy?** Is that reason still valid?

2. **Is this emotion or logic?** Fear/greed or real reasoning?

3. **Where does the money go after selling?** Is there a better place?

4. **Tax implications?** Short-term holdings are taxed higher (US: short-term = income tax, long-term = capital gains 15-20%)

5. **Will I regret it?** If it goes up 50% after, can I accept that?

## When to Sell Index Funds

If you bought index funds, the timing is simple:

```
When young: Don't sell
Middle-aged: Don't sell
Retired: Sell 4% per year (4% rule)
```

**That simple.**

## One Line

> **There are only three reasons to sell: need the money, thesis changed, or better option. Everything else is an excuse.**

## Checklist

- [ ] I have a clear reason to sell (one of the three)
- [ ] I'm not selling because of emotions
- [ ] I've considered tax implications
- [ ] I'm prepared not to regret
