# Chapter 5: When in Doubt, Buy the Index

> "Sarah said: When you don't know what to buy, buy the whole market."

## The Story

In 2008, Sarah gave me advice:

"Buy index funds. Don't pick stocks. Just buy the S&P 500."

"Why not pick individual stocks?"

"**Because you're not Buffett. Neither are 99% of people.**"

"But..."

"Listen, professional fund managers have entire teams doing research, and 95% of them can't beat the index long-term. You alone — can you do better than them?"

I bought the Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund (VOO).

In 2024, Sarah retired.

"You really stayed at Google for 16 years?"

"Yep. My investment strategy is boring — **buy the index, hold, don't touch.**"

"That's it?"

"**That's it. Boring makes money.**"

## The Rules

### Rule 1: Index Funds > Individual Stocks

| Individual Stocks | Index Funds |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Must pick the right company | Buy a basket of companies |
| Can go to zero | Very hard to go to zero |
| Requires research | No research needed |
| 95% of people underperform the market | Guaranteed to get market average returns |

### Rule 2: Fees Matter

Index fund fees vary greatly:

| Type | Annual Fee | $100,000 lost over 30 years |
|------|------------|----------------------------|
| Cheap index fund | 0.03% | $900 |
| Expensive active fund | 1.5% | $45,000 |

**That's a $50,000 difference.**

So choose low-fee options:
- Vanguard VOO: 0.03%
- Fidelity FXAIX: 0.015%
- iShares IVV: 0.03%

### Rule 3: Don't Over-Diversify

You only need 2-4 funds:

```
Simplest (1 fund):
- 100%: VT (Total World Stock Index)

Simple (2 funds):
- 80%: VOO (US Stock Index)
- 20%: BND (US Bond Index)

Advanced (3 funds):
- 60%: VOO (US Stock Index)
- 20%: VXUS (International Stocks)
- 20%: BND (US Bond Index)
```

## FAQ

### Q: Which index fund should I buy?

A: If you only buy one, buy **VOO** (or SPY, IVV).

### Q: When should I buy?

A: Now. Then keep buying every month. Don't wait.

### Q: When should I sell?

A: When you retire. Or when you need the money. Don't sell just because it went up or down.

### Q: Won't I make less money this way?

A: The S&P 500 averaged ~10%/year over the past 30 years.
$100,000 becomes $1.7 million after 30 years.
That's enough.
