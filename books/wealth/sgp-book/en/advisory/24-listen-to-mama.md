## 25 Years Later

2025. Mike, Sarah, and I at a café in Palo Alto.

We're all older. Mike's hair is white, my back isn't great, Sarah has started painting.

"25 years," Mike said.

"Yeah, 25 years."

"What have you learned?" Mike asked.

I thought about it.

"Listen to Mama."

## Mama's Wisdom

Over these 25 years, I made many mistakes. But every time I looked back, Mama had already told me.

### About Investing

> "Don't put all your eggs in one basket."

Diversify. Mike didn't listen. Lost twice.

> "Bubbles are like soda. Feels great drinking it, embarrassing when you burp."

2000 dot-com bubble, 2021 crypto craze — every generation has its bubble.

> "If you can't understand what someone is saying, they're either a genius or a con artist. Geniuses are rare."

Enron, Theranos, FTX — every one of them talked about "complex innovation."

### About Life

> "Slow and steady wins the race."

Compound interest needs time. Careers need accumulation. No shortcuts.

> "Not every battle is worth fighting. Sometimes the smartest thing is to walk away."

Leaving DataSphere was one of the best decisions I ever made.

> "Trees that survive winter have the deepest roots."

The 2000 bubble, 2008 crisis, 2020 pandemic — I survived each one.

### About Common Sense

> "When everyone says something can't happen, it's usually already happening."

"House prices won't fall." In 2008, they fell.
"Lehman won't fail." It failed.
"Crypto is the future." FTX is gone.

> "Never trust any prediction that contains the word 'never.'"

Nothing is forever.

## Common Sense vs Cleverness

Wall Street has many "clever people."

They have MBAs, PhDs, complex models.

But many of them lose more than ordinary people.

Why?

**Because they're so clever they forgot common sense.**

Mama never went to college. She ran a restaurant in Baton Rouge.

But her advice is more useful than any investment book.

## Simple Rules

What I've learned in 25 years can be summarized:

1. **Diversify** — Don't put all eggs in one basket
2. **Hold long-term** — Compound interest needs time
3. **Don't invest in what you don't understand** — Money outside your circle of competence isn't yours
4. **Be greedy when others are fearful** — But first, have cash
5. **Don't chase highs and sell lows** — Systems beat emotions
6. **Save money** — Real security comes from your bank account
7. **Separate human capital from financial capital** — Don't buy company stock
8. **Time is more valuable than money** — Money is a tool, not the goal
9. **Teach kids about money** — The best inheritance is the right values
10. **Listen to Mama** — Common sense beats cleverness

## The Last Story

Last Christmas, I went back to Baton Rouge.

Mama's restaurant is still there, though she doesn't cook anymore.

I sat in my old spot and had a bowl of Gumbo.

Sarah was there too. She flew in from San Francisco.

"Son," Mama asked, "is this your girlfriend?"

Sarah and I looked at each other and laughed.

"Mama, we've known each other for 25 years."

"So what are you waiting for?"

Sarah blushed.

I blushed too.

Mama said: "**Slow is fine, but not so slow you die of old age.**"
