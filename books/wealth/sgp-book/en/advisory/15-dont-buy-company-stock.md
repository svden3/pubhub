# Chapter 15: Don't Mix Human Capital with Financial Capital

> "Sarah said: You've already bet your human capital there. Don't bet your financial capital too."

## The Story

Mike worked at Enron.

The company gave him a $50,000 bonus. He put it all in company stock.

"I believe in the company."

In 2001, Enron went bankrupt.

Mike lost his job.

Mike's stock went to zero.

**Double kill.**

---

Later, Mike went to Lehman.

He put all his bonus in the company again.

In 2008, Lehman went bankrupt.

Mike lost his job again.

Mike's investments shrank again.

**Same mistake, made twice.**

## Why This Is Dangerous

### You Have Two Types of Capital at Your Company

| Capital Type | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| **Human Capital** | Your salary, skills, career growth |
| **Financial Capital** | Your invested money |

If you buy company stock, you're **double betting** on the same company.

### Risk Calculation

```
Normal situation:
- Human capital at Company A
- Financial capital spread across A, B, C, D...
- A has problems → You lose your job, but investments remain

Mike's situation:
- Human capital at Enron
- Financial capital also at Enron
- Enron has problems → Unemployed + Investments go to zero
```

**This is the worst diversification.**

## The Rules

### Rule 1: Don't Buy Company Stock

Unless:
- The RSU/ESPP the company gives you is free
- You sell immediately after buying

### Rule 2: If You Have RSU, Sell Early

Many companies give employees RSU (Restricted Stock Units).

**Sell as soon as you get it.**

Don't hold because "I believe in the company."

You've already bet your time and career on the company. Don't bet your money too.

### Rule 3: If You Have ESPP, Buy and Sell

Many companies let employees buy stock at a discount (usually 15% off).

Strategy:
1. Buy at maximum allocation
2. Sell immediately
3. Lock in 15% profit

**Don't hold.**

## Exceptions

### What If You Work at FAANG?

"But I work at Google/Apple/Meta, the stock keeps going up!"

Ask yourself:

1. Can you predict the stock price in 10 years?
2. If the stock drops 50% AND you lose your job, can you handle it?
3. Do you understand the company better than the market?

**If the answer is "not sure," sell.**

Sarah worked at Google for 16 years, but she:
- Regularly sold RSU
- Used the proceeds to buy index funds
- Stayed diversified

## Real Data

Maximum company stock as percentage of portfolio:

| Risk Tolerance | Maximum % |
|----------------|-----------|
| Conservative | 5% |
| Moderate | 10% |
| Aggressive | 15% |

**Beyond this percentage, you should sell.**

---

## One Line

> **Your salary is already bet on the company. Don't bet your savings too.**

---

## Checklist

- [ ] I don't hold a lot of company stock (< 10%)
- [ ] I sell RSU when I receive it
- [ ] I participate in ESPP for the discount, not long-term holding
- [ ] My human capital and financial capital are separate

## Three Mentors Say

| Mentor | Wisdom |
|--------|--------|
| **Sun Tzu** | "Divide your portion to seven, or even to eight" — Spread your forces, don't put everything in one place |
| **Graham** | "Diversification is protection against ignorance" — Admit you don't know everything about the company |
| **Bible** | "Do not put your trust in uncertain riches" (1 Timothy 6:17) — Both job and investments can be lost |
