# Chapter 16: Always Have a Plan B

> "Sarah said: In your career, always have a Plan B. Don't put your fate entirely in someone else's hands."

## The Story

In 2011, I worked at DataSphere.

The boss was Indian. His boss was Indian too. I wasn't one of "their people."

Six months later, performance review.

"Jim, your technical skills are great, but your cultural integration needs improvement."

I understood. I would never be one of them.

I resigned.

That night, I called Sarah.

"I was pushed out."

"**But do you have a Plan B?**"

"What Plan B?"

"**Savings. Skills. Network. Stock options are just icing on the cake. Real security comes from the number in your bank account.**"

---

## What Is Plan B

Plan B isn't "what if I get laid off."

Plan B is **your card that lets you survive any situation**.

### The Three Pillars of Plan B

| Pillar | Content | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Savings** | 6-12 months living expenses | Gives you time to find next step |
| **Skills** | Transferable abilities | Gives you options |
| **Network** | People who can help you | Gets you opportunities |

## Savings: Your Safety Cushion

### Rules

- At least 6 months of living expenses
- In an accessible account
- Not used for investing

### Why 6 Months

Finding a job takes 3-6 months on average.

In a bad economy, it can take longer.

**Without savings, you'll be forced to accept the first offer, even if it's terrible.**

With savings, you can be choosy.

## Skills: Your Transferable Abilities

### What Are Transferable Skills

Abilities that don't depend on any single company:

| Not Transferable | Transferable |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Internal company systems | Programming languages |
| Company processes | Problem-solving ability |
| Company contacts | Industry network |
| Company title | Actual skills |

### How to Build Them

1. **Learn universal technologies** — Don't only know company tools
2. **Do side projects** — Prove you can complete things independently
3. **Write/Speak** — Build personal brand
4. **Get certifications** — Sometimes useful

---

## Network: Your Source of Opportunities

### Statistics

> 70% of jobs are found through networking, not job boards.

### How to Build

1. **Stay in touch** — Don't only contact people when you need help
2. **Help others** — Give first, ask later
3. **Attend industry events** — Online and offline
4. **LinkedIn** — Stay active, but don't be annoying

### When to Use

**Don't start building your network only when you need a job.**

Start when you don't need one.

## The 2024 Story

I got PIP'd at my new company.

Three months later, HR gave me a severance package.

24 years of career, ended with one check.

But this time was different.

**This time I had savings. I had skills. I had network.**

Sarah said: "**This time you have money. You can walk away.**"

## One Line

> **Don't put your fate entirely in someone else's hands. Your security comes from yourself.**

- [ ] I have 6-12 months of living expenses saved
- [ ] My skills are useful at other companies
