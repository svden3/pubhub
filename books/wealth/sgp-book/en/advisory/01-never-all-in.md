# Chapter 1: Never Go All-In on One Basket

## The Story

Mike worked at Enron.

The company gave him a $50,000 signing bonus. He put it all into company stock.

"This is the most innovative company in America!" he said.

In 2001, Enron went bankrupt. His $50,000 in stock became 37 cents.

Later he went to Lehman. He put all his money into a Manhattan apartment.

In 2008, Lehman collapsed. The apartment lost 40% of its value.

**Mike made the same mistake twice.**

## The Rules

### Rule 1: Don't put all your money in one stock

No matter how much you believe in a company, put no more than 10% of your money in it.

### Rule 2: Don't buy your employer's stock

Your salary is already tied to that company. If it fails, you lose your job AND your investment. This is called **double risk**.

### Rule 3: Don't put all your money in one bank

In 2023, Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in 48 hours. Many startups almost couldn't make payroll.

FDIC only insures $250,000. Above that, spread across multiple banks.

## How to Do It

### The Simplest Diversification

```
Your portfolio = US stocks + US bonds + Cash

Ratios:
- Young: 70% stocks + 20% bonds + 10% cash
- Middle-aged: 50% stocks + 30% bonds + 20% cash
- Near retirement: 30% stocks + 50% bonds + 20% cash
```

### One Line

> **Don't put all your eggs in one basket, especially the basket where you work.**
