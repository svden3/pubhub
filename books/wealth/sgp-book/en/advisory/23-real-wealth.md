# Chapter 23: Real Wealth Is Time

> "Sarah said: Real wealth is time, not money. Money can buy time, but time can't be bought back."

## The Story

In 2024, Sarah called me.

"I retired last month."

"Retired? You're only 48."

"**Google stock is enough for me to live three lifetimes. I want to paint now.**"

She worked at Google for 16 years. Picked the right company, got stock options, held, didn't touch.

Now she can do anything she wants.

**This is real wealth — the freedom to choose.**

## What Is "Financial Freedom"

It's NOT:
- Having ten million dollars
- Living in mansions and driving luxury cars
- Not working

It IS:
- **Being able to not work**, but choosing to do what you love
- **Not worrying about money**, so you can focus on what truly matters
- **Having time** for family, yourself, and the world

## The Math of Financial Freedom

### The 4% Rule

How much money do you need to live each year?

**Annual expenses × 25 = Financial freedom number**

| Annual Expenses | Amount Needed |
|-----------------|---------------|
| $40,000 | $1,000,000 |
| $80,000 | $2,000,000 |
| $120,000 | $3,000,000 |
| $200,000 | $5,000,000 |

### Why 25x

Historical data shows that withdrawing 4% per year, your money probably won't run out.

This is called the **safe withdrawal rate**.

## Time vs Money

### The Question

| Option A | Option B |
|----------|----------|
| $200,000/year salary | $150,000/year salary |
| 60 hours/week work | 40 hours/week work |
| 1 hour commute | Remote work |
| No time for kids | Pick up kids from school daily |

**Which is wealthier?**

Many choose A.

But A's "hourly rate" is actually lower.

### Real Hourly Rate

| Option | Annual | Actual Work Hours | Real Hourly |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| A | $200,000 | 60h/week + 10h commute = 3,640h/year | $55/h |
| B | $150,000 | 40h/week = 2,080h/year | $72/h |

**B has a higher hourly rate. And has a life.**

## The Value of Time

What is your time worth?

### Calculation

Your annual salary ÷ 2,080 = Your hourly rate

| Annual Salary | Hourly Rate |
|---------------|-------------|
| $100,000 | $48 |
| $150,000 | $72 |
| $200,000 | $96 |

### Use Hourly Rate for Decisions

| Task | Time | Cost to Outsource? | Decision |
|------|------|-------------------|----------|
| House cleaning | 3 hours | $100 | Outsource (save $144) |
| DIY taxes | 10 hours | $500 | Outsource (save $460) |
| Cooking | 1 hour | But I enjoy it | Do it myself (not about money) |

**Some things are worth paying for rather than spending time on.**

## How to Buy Back Time

### 1. Spend Money to Buy Time

- Hire a house cleaner
- Use delivery to save cooking time (occasionally)
- Live close to work to save commute
- Hire an accountant for taxes

### 2. Reduce Spending to Buy Time

- Less stuff = less money spent = can work less
- $50,000/year expenses vs $100,000/year expenses
- The former needs $1.25M to retire, the latter needs $2.5M

**The less you spend, the sooner you're free.**

### 3. Invest to Buy Time

- Invest $1,000 today
- 30 years later it becomes $17,000
- That's several months of freedom

**Today's $1,000 = future months of life.**

## One Line

> **Money is a tool, time is the goal. Use money to buy time, don't trade time for money.**

---

## Checklist

- [ ] I know my "real hourly rate"
- [ ] I use my hourly rate to make spending decisions
- [ ] I'm using money to buy back time
- [ ] I know my financial freedom number
