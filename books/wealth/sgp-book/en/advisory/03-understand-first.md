# Chapter 3: Don't Invest in What You Don't Understand

> "Mama said: If you can't understand what someone is saying, they're either a genius or a con artist. Geniuses are rare."

## The Stories

### Enron

Mike asked Sarah: "What does Enron actually do?"

"They... create value."

"How?"

"Through complex financial instruments."

Sarah's dad was a CPA. He said: "**If a company's financials require a genius to understand, they're either doing Nobel Prize-level innovation or prison-level fraud.**"

Enron collapsed. The CEO went to prison.

### Theranos

Elizabeth Holmes said: "One drop of blood tests for all diseases!"

A recruiter found me: "Theranos is hiring AI engineers."

Sarah asked her dad. Her dad said: "This medical tech company has never published a single peer-reviewed paper."

I declined the offer.

Theranos collapsed. Holmes was convicted of fraud.

That machine never actually worked.

## The Rules

### Rule 1: The Three-Sentence Test

If you can't explain in three sentences how an investment makes money, **don't buy it**.

✅ Passes:
- "Apple sells iPhones; more users, more profit"
- "Index funds buy a basket of stocks; economy grows, it grows"
- "This rental property generates $2,000/month rent"

❌ Fails:
- "They create value through complex financial instruments"
- "It's a decentralized metaverse ecosystem"
- "They're using AI to disrupt traditional industries"

### Rule 2: Ask Three Questions

1. **How does it make money?**
2. **Why this one, not competitors?**
3. **If I'm wrong, how much do I lose?**

Can't answer? Don't invest.

### Rule 3: Complex ≠ Sophisticated

Scammers love complex words.

People who truly understand can explain complex things simply.

**If they can't explain clearly, either they don't understand, or they're deceiving you.**

When you hear these, be careful:

| "This is disruptive innovation" | We're not making money yet |
| "Miss this and it's gone forever" | I need you to decide quickly |
| "Guaranteed 20% returns" | This is probably a scam |
| "Effective altruism" | I'm doing charity with your money |
