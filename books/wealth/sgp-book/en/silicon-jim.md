## My Name is Jim

My name is Jim. Friends call me "Silicon Jim."

I'm from Baton Rouge, Louisiana—just north of New Orleans. That's where we got the Mississippi River, crawfish, and my mama.

Mama ran a little restaurant in Baton Rouge, serving Cajun food. She always said, "Son, running a business is like making Gumbo. You need the right heat, the right ingredients, and most importantly—patience."

I studied computer science at LSU. Mike was my roommate. We watched LSU Tigers football together, drank beer together, and dreamed about leaving the South to see the world.

In 2000, the dot-com bubble was red hot. I got an offer from a top AI company in Silicon Valley.

"AI? What's that?" Mama asked.

"Artificial Intelligence, Mama. Making machines think like people."

"Can machines make Gumbo?"

"Uh... not yet."

"Then they ain't smart enough."

Mama drove me to the airport. She handed me a box of pralines.

"Son," she said, "California folks don't know what real food is. But remember what Mama told you—"

"What's that, Mama?"

"**Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.**"

I took that box of pralines and flew to Silicon Valley.

Over the next 25 years, I witnessed everything that happened on this strange piece of land—bubbles, crashes, fortunes made, fortunes lost, and the people who changed my life forever.

## Chapter 1: 2000 — The Stanford AI Dream

### My First Day in Silicon Valley

"Welcome to the future!"

That's what the airport shuttle driver told me. He said he'd just sold his house to buy internet stocks.

"Pets.com is going to the moon, you know? Selling dog food online!"

I didn't really understand, but I nodded anyway.

### NeuralMind

The company I joined was called NeuralMind, a startup spun out of the Stanford AI Lab.

The founders were two Stanford professors. Our office was on Page Mill Road, not far from the HP garage.

"We're going to make machines understand human language!" the CTO said, drawing neural networks on the whiteboard. "This is the future!"

The company gave me 0.05% in stock options.

"What's that worth?" I asked HR.

"If we IPO, maybe... $500,000?"

Half a million! I'd never seen that much money. Mama's restaurant made $50,000 a year.

### Sarah

On my first day, I met Sarah Chen in the break room.

She was a product manager, a Berkeley grad, ABC (American Born Chinese), with long black hair and dimples when she smiled.

"You're the new engineer?" she asked.

"Uh... yes. Jim, from Louisiana."

"Louisiana?" Her eyes lit up. "I love Cajun food! Can you make Gumbo?"

"My mama can."

"Then you'll have to cook for me."

At that moment, I thought Silicon Valley wasn't so bad.

### The First Winter

In March 2000, NASDAQ hit 5000.

In April, it started falling.

Socks.com next door went bust. Their CEO waved a sock puppet at the final all-hands: "Colleagues, we spiritually disrupted the sock industry!"

NeuralMind didn't die, but funding froze.

"AI is too ahead of its time," investors said. "Come back when the market is ready."

The professors went back to Stanford to continue their research. The company went from 50 people to 12. I was one of the 12 who stayed.

Sarah stayed too.

"Why me?" I asked the CTO.

"Because you're cheap, you're good, and you don't complain."

That night, Sarah took me to In-N-Out.

"Jim," she said, "you know your options are worthless now, right?"

"I know."

"Why did you stay?"

I thought about it. "Because I believe in this technology. And... because you stayed too."

She smiled, dimples deep.

"Idiot."

**Mama said: Bubbles are like soda. Fun to drink, embarrassing when you burp.**

**But she also said: Trees that survive winter grow the deepest roots.**

---

## Chapter 2: 2001 — Enron's "Innovation"

### Mike Goes to Enron

After graduation, my college roommate Mike went to Houston to join Enron.

"They're revolutionizing energy trading!" Mike said excitedly. "The CEO says we're the most innovative company in America! They gave me a $50,000 signing bonus!"

I asked, "What exactly do you do?"

Mike thought for a moment. "We... create value."

"How?"

"Through complex financial instruments."

"What instruments?"

"Too complex. You wouldn't understand. Anyway, the stock keeps going up! I put my whole bonus into company stock."

### Sarah's Warning

One day, Sarah and I had lunch together.

"Your roommate is at Enron?" she asked.

"Yeah, Mike. He says it's the most innovative company in America."

Sarah frowned. "My dad is a CPA. He says he can't understand Enron's financial statements."

"Can't understand?"

"Too complex. My dad says, **if a company's financials require a genius to understand, either they're doing Nobel Prize-level innovation, or prison-level fraud.**"

"Which one do you think?"

"Geniuses are rare."

### The Christmas Phone Call

In November 2001, Mike called me.

"Jim, I lost my job."

"What happened?"

"Enron went bankrupt."

"Bankrupt? Weren't you the most innovative company in America?"

"Yeah. Turns out 'innovative' means 'accounting fraud.' My $50,000 in stock is now worth... 37 cents."

### Dr. Harlon Trailer's Sleeping Bag

Two weeks later, Mike showed up at my Sunnyvale apartment door.

He was carrying a worn-out olive-green sleeping bag. His eyes were bloodshot.

"What's that?" I pointed at the sleeping bag.

"Dr. Harlon Trailer's."

"Who?"

"My landlord's father. A Korean War veteran. The old man passed away last year and left me this sleeping bag. He said it was with him from Inchon all the way to the Yalu River, and back again during the retreat."

Mike spread the sleeping bag on my living room floor.

"The old man said, 'Son, life is like war. Sometimes you're advancing, sometimes you're retreating. There's no shame in retreat. Staying alive means you can fight another day.'"

Sarah made a pot of pasta. The three of us sat on the floor eating.

"Mike," Sarah said, "you made a mistake."

"What?"

"You put all your eggs in one basket. And it was the same basket you worked in."

"But I believed in the company!"

"**Never buy your company's stock with your salary. You've already bet your human capital there. Don't bet your financial capital too.**"

Mike was silent.

That winter, he slept in the Korean War veteran's sleeping bag, sending out resumes every day, getting rejected every day.

Three months later, he got an offer from Bear Stearns.

"Wall Street!" he said excitedly. "This time it's real finance! A hundred-year-old firm!"

He rolled up the sleeping bag and stuffed it in his suitcase.

"I'm taking it to New York. Dr. Trailer said this sleeping bag brings good luck."

Sarah said, "Remember this lesson. **Diversify.**"

Mike nodded.

He didn't remember.

**Mama said: If someone says something you can't understand, either they're a genius or they're a con man. Geniuses are rare. Con men are common.**

**Sarah said: Never put all your eggs in one basket, especially the basket you work in.**

---

## Chapter 3: 2004 — Missing Google

### Sarah's Choice

In 2004, Sarah told me she was leaving NeuralMind.

"Where to?"

"Google."

"The search engine?" I said. "Isn't Yahoo already doing well?"

Sarah smiled. "Jim, have you used Google?"

"Yes. It's fast."

"Then why do you think Yahoo is better?"

I couldn't answer.

"They gave me an offer," Sarah said. "Lower base, but 0.01% in options."

"0.01%? Doesn't sound like much."

"If they IPO, could be worth millions."

"What if they don't?"

"Then it's worthless paper." She looked at me. "Jim, want to come? I can refer you."

I thought about it. NeuralMind's CTO had been good to me. The company was small but stable. AI was my passion.

"Let me think about it."

Sarah waited two weeks.

I didn't go.

### IPO

In August 2004, Google went public.

Opening price: $85.

First day close: $100.

Sarah's 0.01%... I couldn't bring myself to calculate.

That night, I called Sarah.

"Congratulations."

"Thanks." Her voice was calm. "Jim, do you regret it?"

"A little."

"**Regret is an investor's worst enemy. Once you make a decision, don't look back.**"

"Who said that?"

"My dad. After he lost a lot of money in stocks."

### Another Neighbor

My neighbor in Silicon Valley, Kevin, joined a little company called "The Facebook" that same year.

"They make you work 18 hours a day!" he complained. "But they gave me 0.1% in stock options."

"0.1%? Facebook? What's that?"

"Social network for college students. Only Harvard students can use it."

"Sounds... niche."

Kevin shrugged. "It's not like I had other offers."

**Mama said: When opportunity comes, it usually doesn't look like opportunity.**

**I say: But back then, I didn't have Mama's vision.**

---

## Chapter 4: 2007 — Mike Goes to Wall Street

### Bear Stearns

After Enron, Mike moved to New York.

"Wall Street is real finance!" he said. "I'm at Bear Stearns now. A hundred-year-old firm!"

He bought an apartment in Manhattan.

"Real estate only goes up," he said. "This is New York!"

He put all his bonuses into the down payment.

### The Smell of Subprime

In 2007, Mike invited me to visit New York.

"We're making these products called MBS, CDO," he explained. "Basically, we package mortgages and sell them to investors."

"Sounds complicated."

"Actually, it's simple—housing prices go up, everyone makes money."

"What if housing prices go down?"

Mike laughed. "Jim, housing prices don't go down. This is America!"

After I got back to Silicon Valley, I called Sarah.

"Mike is working on some financial product I don't understand."

Sarah was quiet for a moment.

"What does your dad say?"

"My dad says, **when everyone is using complex methods to explain a simple problem, that problem is usually not the one they're talking about.**"

"What does that mean?"

"It means they're hiding something."

**Mama said: When everyone says something can't happen, it's usually already happening.**

---

## Chapter 5: 2008 — Lehman Weekend

### That Phone Call

September 14, 2008. Sunday night. Mike called.

"Jim, Bear Stearns already got bought by JPMorgan. Now I'm at Lehman Brothers."

"That's good, right?"

"Tomorrow it might not exist."

"What do you mean?"

"We can't find a buyer. The government won't save us."

### Monday Morning

Monday, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy.

Mike stood on a Manhattan street, holding a cardboard box.

In the box was everything he had—a cactus plant, a photo frame, and an "Employee of the Year" certificate.

"Innovative finance," he said with a bitter smile. "Here we go again."

His Manhattan apartment was bought at the 2007 peak. Now underwater by 30%.

### Sarah's Phone Call

That night, Sarah called me.

"Jim, how much cash do you have?"

"About... $150,000? Saved over the years."

"Now is the time to buy stocks."

"Are you crazy? The world is ending!"

"**The world isn't ending. Fear is the best buy signal.**"

"But..."

"Do you believe the American economy will recover?"

"...Yes."

"Then buy index funds. Don't pick stocks, just buy the S&P 500. **When you don't know what to buy, buy the whole market.**"

I hesitated for a long time.

Finally, I put $100,000 into the Vanguard S&P 500 index fund.

At that time, the S&P 500 was at 1,200.

### Mike's Second Layoff

Mike showed up at my door again.

This time he didn't have the sleeping bag. He'd sold Dr. Trailer's sleeping bag for a plane ticket to San Francisco.

"I sold the Manhattan apartment," he said. "Lost 40%."

"How much do you have left?"

"$50,000."

"What are you going to do?"

"Find a job." He looked at my living room floor. "Can I sleep here?"

Sarah made another pot of pasta.

"Mike," she said, "you made the same mistake again."

"I know. Put all my eggs in one basket again."

"Not just that." Sarah said, "**You always buy at the top and sell at the bottom. That's called chasing highs and cutting losses.**"

"What should I do?"

"**Do the opposite. Be greedy when others are fearful, fearful when others are greedy.**"

"Easy to say."

"Hard to do. That's why most people lose money."

**Mama said: History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.**

**Sarah said: Be greedy when others are fearful. But first, you need the capital to be greedy—cash.**

---

## Chapter 6: 2009 — Rock Bottom and Hope

### NeuralMind Is Still Alive

In 2009, NeuralMind was still alive.

We went from 12 people to 30. No big funding rounds, but steady enterprise clients—document analysis for banks, contract review for law firms.

"Not sexy," the CTO said, "but it pays the rent."

I went from writing code to leading small projects. Life was stable. Boring, but stable.

### Rock Bottom

In March 2009, the market hit bottom. S&P 500 fell to 666.

My $100,000 in index funds had shrunk to $55,000.

I called Sarah.

"Should I sell?"

"Are you crazy? **Now is the time to add more.**"

"But I've lost 45%."

"That's just paper losses. Look at those companies—Apple, Google, Microsoft—has their business disappeared?"

"No."

"Then don't sell. **The hardest part of investing isn't buying. It's holding.**"

I didn't sell.

I added another $50,000.

### Mike's New Job

Mike later went to UBS, then JPMorgan.

"Too big to fail," he said. "From now on, I only work at places too big to fail."

"Is that an investment strategy?"

"Survival strategy."

### Kevin at Facebook

My neighbor Kevin was still at Facebook.

"They're going to IPO," he said. "Maybe next year, maybe the year after."

"How much is your 0.1% worth now?"

Kevin smiled, said nothing.

**Mama said: Be greedy when others are fearful. But first, make sure you have enough money to survive until they stop being fearful.**

---

## Chapter 7: 2011 — The Humiliation

### NeuralMind Dies

In 2011, NeuralMind finally ran out of runway.

The CTO gathered us in the conference room. His eyes were red.

"Colleagues, we fought the good fight. But the market... the market still isn't ready for AI."

Eleven years. From 50 people to 12, then back to 30, now to zero.

My 0.05% options became worthless paper.

I packed my things. A Stanford coffee mug. A stack of technical papers. Eleven years of my life in one cardboard box.

Sarah called me. She'd been at Google for seven years, now a Senior PM.

"Jim, I'm sorry."

"It's okay. Options are just lottery tickets anyway."

"Are you okay?"

"I'm fine. At least my index funds recovered. Even made a profit."

She laughed. "**See, that's the point of diversification. Your human capital went to zero, but your financial capital is still there.**"

### DataSphere

I needed a job. The market was tough. After two months, I got an offer from a company called DataSphere.

"Enterprise data solutions," the recruiter said. "Fast-growing. Good opportunity."

The CEO was Indian. The CTO was Indian. My manager was Indian. His manager was also Indian.

"Welcome to the team," my manager Vikram said. "You have good experience. We value experience here."

The first month was fine. I wrote code, attended meetings, kept my head down.

### The Meeting

In the second month, there was a design review.

I presented my architecture proposal. Fifteen years of experience went into it.

Vikram listened, nodding. Then he said:

"Jim, this is... interesting. But I think we should use a different approach."

He pulled up his own design. It was almost identical to mine, with a few minor changes.

"This is the DataSphere way," he said. "More aligned with our culture."

The room was silent. Everyone knew what just happened.

### Priya

A month later, Vikram's "cousin" Priya parachuted in from Bangalore, straight into the Tech Lead position.

"She has great experience," Vikram said. "Five years at Infosys."

Priya was 25, spoke English with a heavy Indian accent, mediocre technical skills, but very good at talking in meetings.

She started attending all my meetings, then repeating my points as if they were her own.

### The Performance Review

Six months in, I got my first performance review.

"Jim, your technical skills are good," Vikram said. "But your culture fit needs improvement."

"Culture fit?"

"Yes. You need to be more... collaborative. More aligned with the team."

I looked at him. "I've been in this industry for fifteen years. I've shipped products that actually work. What exactly needs improvement?"

Vikram smiled. The kind of smile that doesn't reach the eyes.

"Jim, this is not about the past. This is about the future. Our future."

I understood. I wasn't one of them. I would never be one of them.

### Leaving

I quit DataSphere after eight months.

No dramatic exit. No angry words. I just stopped showing up one day.

That night, I called Mama.

"Mama, I quit my job."

"Why?"

I thought about how to explain it. The politics. The tribalism. The quiet humiliation.

"They didn't want me there, Mama. Not really."

Mama was quiet for a moment.

"Son, some places aren't meant for you. That doesn't mean you're wrong. It means the place is wrong."

Then I called Sarah.

"Jim," she said, "this isn't your fault. But it's a lesson."

"What lesson?"

"**In your career, always have a Plan B. Don't put your fate entirely in someone else's hands.**"

"What's Plan B?"

"Savings. Skills. Network. Options are just icing on the cake. **Real security comes from the numbers in your bank account.**"

**Mama said: Not every battle is worth fighting. Sometimes the smartest thing is to walk away.**

**Sarah said: The best revenge is living well.**

---

## Chapter 8: 2012 — Back to AI

### Kevin's Facebook IPO

In May 2012, Facebook went public.

My neighbor Kevin, his 0.1% became... a lot of zeros.

"Jim," he said, "I'm moving to Atherton."

Atherton has one of the most expensive zip codes in America.

I didn't buy Facebook stock.

"Social media?" I said at the time. "A toy for kids."

I called Sarah.

"I missed it again."

"Jim, **you can't catch every opportunity. What matters is catching the one that's yours.**"

"What's mine?"

"AI. That's your field. Wait for it."

### NeuralMind Rises Again

After DataSphere, I was lost. Eight months of humiliation had broken something in me.

Then I got a call from an old friend—the CTO from NeuralMind.

"Jim, remember how the company shut down? Well, a VC just bought our IP. They want to restart. Interested?"

The new company was called NeuralMind 2.0. Same mission, different funding.

"AI for enterprise," the new CEO said. "Document processing. Contract analysis. Boring stuff that actually makes money."

They gave me options again. This time 0.1%.

"Last time's 0.05% became worthless paper," I said.

"This time is different. We have customers."

I joined as Senior Engineer. No fancy title. Just code.

It felt like coming home.

Sarah said: "**Sometimes you have to leave home to appreciate it. This time remember, options are just lottery tickets. Your real assets are your skills and bank savings.**"

**Mama said: When you think young people are doing something stupid, either you're right, or you're old. Usually it's the latter.**

---

## Chapter 9: 2015 — Theranos Blood

### Silicon Valley's New Goddess

Elizabeth Holmes was on magazine covers.

"One drop of blood to detect all diseases!" she said.

Investors lined up to give money. Walgreens signed a deal. Henry Kissinger joined the board.

I went to one of her talks.

She wore a black turtleneck (like Steve Jobs) and spoke in a deep voice (supposedly she practiced).

"We're going to change healthcare!"

### Almost Joined

After the talk, a recruiter found me.

"Jim, Theranos is hiring AI engineers. Interested?"

"Doing what?"

"Using machine learning to analyze blood samples. Great salary, plus options."

I went home to think about it, called Sarah.

"What do you think about Theranos?"

"My dad looked at all their materials. Not a single peer-reviewed paper."

"What does that mean?"

"**A medical tech company that hasn't published a single academic paper. Either they're keeping the next Nobel Prize secret, or they don't have any technology at all.**"

"But so many big names invested..."

"**Big names have money to gamble. You don't.**"

I turned down the offer.

### Bubble Burst 2.0

In 2018, Theranos collapsed. Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of fraud.

The machine never worked.

I thought of Enron, thought of Mike's $50,000 in stock.

Sarah said: "**Con men share one trait: you can't understand what they're saying, but they're very confident saying it.**"

**Mama said: Confidence and competence are two different things. Con men are usually very confident, because they know they're conning you.**

---

## Chapter 10: 2020 — Zoom In

### The Pandemic Arrives

In March 2020, the whole world stayed home.

I started having Zoom meetings. Eight Zooms a day.

Mike was in New York, also on Zoom.

"Jim, I haven't worn pants in three months," he said. "Suit on top, pajamas on bottom."

### NeuralMind's Spring

During the pandemic, everyone suddenly needed AI.

"Remote work needs automation!" clients said.

"Too many documents, we need machines to process them!" other clients said.

NeuralMind 2.0's revenue tripled. We went from 30 people to 150.

Twenty years since I first arrived in Silicon Valley, AI was finally no longer "too ahead of its time."

I had grown from Senior Engineer to Principal Engineer—the guy everyone asked when things broke.

A big tech company came to talk acquisition. The CTO asked my opinion.

"Sell or not?"

I thought of Mama's words: **Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.**

"Let's wait," I said. "The story isn't over yet."

### Sarah's Palo Alto

During the pandemic, I went to Sarah's place for dinner.

She lived in a single family house in Palo Alto. Bought in 2012 for $1.5 million. Now worth $4 million.

"You really stayed at Google for 16 years?" I asked.

"Yep." She brought out a plate of sushi. "Boring, right?"

"How much is your stock worth now?"

She smiled, said nothing.

"Jim," she said, "**Silicon Valley's biggest secret: the really rich people aren't the founders. They're the early employees who hold their stock long-term.**"

"Why?"

"**Founders get diluted through fundraising. Employees get options, hold after IPO. Compound interest. Time. Patience.**"

"So your strategy is?"

"**Find a good company, stay a long time, don't move around.**"

### Tech Stock Party

During the pandemic, tech stocks soared.

Zoom went from $70 to $500.

"This is the new normal!" analysts said. "Working from home will never end!"

Mike's son Tommy used his college tuition to buy Zoom stock.

In 2022, Zoom fell back to $70.

Tommy said: "Dad, my tuition is gone."

**Mama said: Never trust any prediction that contains the word 'never.'**

---

## Chapter 11: 2021 — GME and Crypto

### Mike's Son

Tommy, 20 years old, was playing something called "Reddit."

"Dad, I'm buying GameStop!"

"The video game store? That company is going bankrupt."

"No, we're going to blow up the Wall Street shorts! To the moon!"

Tommy made money, then lost money, then made more, then lost it all.

"At least," Tommy said, "we sent a message."

"What message?"

"Uh... the power of retail investors?"

Mike called me: "Jim, my son lost all his tuition."

"Did he learn anything?"

"He learned Wall Street is full of crooks."

"That's true. But the method was wrong."

### Cryptocurrency

That same year, I started hearing about "Bitcoin" and "Ethereum."

Tommy said, "Uncle Jim, you have to buy Dogecoin."

"Dog coin?"

"Elon Musk posted a picture of a dog on Twitter!"

I didn't buy.

Dogecoin went from $0.01 to $0.70, then dropped to $0.08.

Sarah said: "**Anything priced by memes is not an investment. It's gambling.**"

**Mama said: When you buy a stock because of a picture of a dog, you're not buying an investment. You're buying a lottery ticket.**

---

## Chapter 12: 2022 — The Fall of FTX

### "Effective Altruism"

Sam Bankman-Fried, 30 years old, worth $26 billion.

He said he was going to donate all his money to charity.

"Effective altruism," he explained. "I make money to help the world."

He lived in a mansion in the Bahamas with nine roommates.

"We're simple idealists," he said.

### Bankruptcy

In November 2022, FTX went bankrupt.

The customers' money... disappeared.

"Effective altruism" became "effective embezzlement."

Tommy lost money too. He put his last few thousand on FTX.

Mike said: "How does this kid step on every landmine?"

Sarah said: "**Because he chases hype, not value. Always chasing, always holding the bag.**"

**Mama said: When someone says they make money to help others, first look at how they spend their own money.**

---

## Chapter 13: 2023 — Silicon Valley Bank's 48 Hours

### Bank Run

March 8, 2023. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) issued an announcement.

March 10, it was dead.

48 hours.

Startup founders I knew were celebrating their funding round on Thursday. By Saturday, they discovered the money in their company accounts might be gone.

"This is Silicon Valley's bank!" they said. "How could it fail?"

### NeuralMind 2.0's Crisis

Our money was in SVB too.

Friday night, the CEO called an emergency meeting.

"We have $5 million in there," he said. "If we can't get it out by Monday, we can't make payroll next month."

We spent the longest 48 hours that weekend.

Sunday night, the government announced it would protect all deposits.

"Too big to fail, again," Mike said on the phone.

"This time it wasn't too big," I said. "It was too Silicon Valley."

Sarah said: "**That's why you diversify your deposits. Never put all your money in one bank.**"

**Mama said: Banks are like doctors—you think they're reliable until you actually need them.**

---

## Chapter 14: 2024 — The Age of AI

### ChatGPT

In 2023, OpenAI released ChatGPT.

The whole world went crazy.

I tried asking it, "What's a good investment?"

It said a lot of things.

Mike asked me, "Will AI replace us?"

I said, "I don't know. But Mama said—"

"What did your mama say?"

"Tools don't replace people. But people who use tools replace people who don't."

### NeuralMind 2.0 Gets Acquired

In 2024, a tech giant acquired NeuralMind 2.0.

My 0.1% options became... a nice number. Not financial freedom, but enough to buy a condo in Sunnyvale and save some for retirement.

At the final all-hands, the CTO said: "Colleagues, we didn't disrupt the world, but we survived. And we actually built something useful."

I thought of that CEO waving a sock puppet back in 2000.

The difference: our technology actually worked.

Sarah called: "Congratulations."

"Thanks. What about you?"

"I retired last month."

"Retired? You're only 48."

"**Google stock is enough for three lifetimes. I want to paint.**"

### Cross-Training

Three months after the acquisition closed, the new owners sent in a "transition team."

Twenty people, all Infosys Consulting Services (ICS) contractors, flown in from Bangalore and Hyderabad.

"Jim," the new SVP Rajesh told me on Zoom (he was still in India), "we need you to help with knowledge transfer."

"Knowledge transfer?"

"Yes. Cross-training. Help our ICS colleagues get up to speed. You know the system best."

For the next three months, my daily schedule looked like this:

- 6 AM: Zoom call with Bangalore team, explaining system architecture
- Morning: Walk contractors through the code, line by line
- Afternoon: Write documentation, turning years of experience into Wiki pages
- 9 PM: Zoom call with Hyderabad team, answering questions

The contractors were young, eager, and worked hard. They called me "Jim Sir" and asked thoughtful questions.

"Jim Sir, why did you design the API this way?"

"Because in 2008, we needed to support legacy clients..."

I explained everything. Not because I had to—because these were good kids who wanted to learn, and I was a teacher at heart.

### The Demotion

After the knowledge transfer was "complete," Rajesh called another Zoom meeting.

"Jim, we've restructured the organization. Your Principal Engineer position has been... consolidated."

"Consolidated?"

"We've created a new role for you: Senior Research Scientist. Same compensation, but... different scope."

I understood. No projects. No system ownership. A title that sounded important but meant I'd be writing documentation until I quit.

"And," Rajesh continued, "we'll need you to go through a performance review period. Just formalities."

PIP. Performance Improvement Plan. The corporate way of saying "start looking for another job."

I called Sarah.

"Here we go again," I said. "Just like DataSphere."

"**But this time is different, Jim.**"

"How?"

"**This time you have money. You can leave.**"

### Getting Kicked Out

Three months later, the PIP concluded exactly as everyone knew it would.

HR was a woman who flew in from Bangalore.

"Here's your severance package," she said. "Thank you so much for your 24 years of contribution."

I looked at the package. The numbers were okay. But my heart was a mess.

24 years. From 12 people to 150. From writing code to Principal Engineer to "Senior Research Scientist." From AI winter to AI spring.

Then, three months of cross-training, one PIP, one check.

Within six months, almost the entire US team had been "optimized." The work moved to Bangalore and Hyderabad.

While I was packing my things, the CTO came to find me. He'd been "integrated" too.

"Jim," he said, "I didn't expect this."

"I did," I said. "From the day they asked me to do cross-training."

"Why did you still teach so diligently?"

I thought about it.

"Because those young people did nothing wrong. They just wanted to learn, to support their families. Just like me in 2000."

The CTO was silent for a moment.

"What are you going to do?"

"Go back to Baton Rouge for a bowl of Gumbo. Then... maybe teach AI to cook."

**Mama always said: The tree you plant may not be the tree you sit under. But at least you planted it.**

**I say: Teaching others isn't failure. Refusing to learn is.**

### The Call to Sarah

That night, I called Sarah.

"I got kicked out of the company."

Silence for a moment.

"Are you okay?"

"I'm fine. This time I have money, I have time, and I have that bottle of wine you gave me."

She laughed. "That wine is for celebrating, not drowning sorrows."

"I know. I'm celebrating."

"Celebrating what?"

"Celebrating that I never have to do a 6 AM Zoom again."

### Nvidia

Nvidia stock went from $100 to $500 to $900.

"AI chips!" analysts shouted. "This is the new oil!"

I thought of the sock puppet from 2000.

But this time, Nvidia was actually making money.

Sarah said: "**The difference between a bubble and a revolution is that a revolution eventually creates real value. But until then, they look exactly the same.**"

**I say: Sometimes, the ones who go slow end up going the furthest.**

## Chapter 15: 2025 — Now

### Coffee Shop Conversation

Today, Mike, Sarah, and I sat in a coffee shop in Palo Alto.

We're all old now. Mike's hair is gray. My back hurts. Sarah has taken up painting.

"Twenty-five years," Mike said.

"Yeah. Twenty-five years."

"What did you learn?" Mike asked.

I thought about it.

"Don't trust sock puppets."

"What else?"

"Things too big to fail still fail. They just fail slower."

Sarah said: "**Real wealth is time, not money. Money can buy time, but time can't be bought back.**"

Mike nodded. "What about my son Tommy?"

"What about him?"

"He asked me last week if he could borrow money to buy Nvidia."

We all laughed.

### The Ledger

Sarah pulled out her phone and showed us a table.

"This is my 25-year investment record."

| Year | Action | Result |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| 2004 | Joined Google, got options | Held 16 years, retired |
| 2009 | Added more at rock bottom | 3x in 10 years |
| 2012 | Bought house in Palo Alto | 2.5x in 8 years |
| 2021 | Didn't buy crypto | Avoided crash |

"What's your secret?" Mike asked.

"**Simple. Pick the right platform, stay a long time, don't move around, diversify, keep cash.**"

"That's it?"

"That's it. **The hardest part of investing isn't knowing. It's doing.**"

### Mama's Words

Mike asked, "How's your mama?"

"She's good. Still calls me every day to remind me to wear more clothes."

"What does she think about the market now?"

"She said—"

"Said what?"

"She said, 'Son, are you sure you're investing and not gambling?'"

Sarah raised her coffee cup: "**To Mama.**"

We clinked cups.

**Mama is always right.**

## Epilogue: Advice for Young People

If you're just arriving in Silicon Valley, here's my advice:

### About Work

1. **Don't chase sock puppets** — Every generation has its bubbles
2. **Don't put human capital and financial capital in the same basket** — Don't buy too much company stock
3. **Always have a Plan B** — Savings, skills, network

### About Investing

4. **If you don't understand it, don't invest** — Complexity usually means risk
5. **Be greedy when others are fearful, fearful when others are greedy** — Easy to say, hard to do
6. **Index funds are the best choice for most people** — Don't pick stocks, buy the whole market
7. **Compound interest takes time** — Twenty years of patience buys freedom

### About Life

8. **Too big to fail just means fails slower** — Not that it won't fail
9. **Fear and greed are eternal** — They just change clothes
10. **Survive long enough** — To see the cycles turn

Most importantly—

**Listen to your mama.**

**And find a friend like Sarah.**

Last Christmas, I went back to Baton Rouge.

Mama's restaurant is still there, though she doesn't cook anymore. I sat in my old seat and had a bowl of Gumbo.

Sarah was there too. She flew in specially from San Francisco.

"Son," Mama asked, "is this your girlfriend?"

Sarah and I looked at each other and laughed.

"Mama, we've known each other for 25 years."

"Then what are you waiting for?"

Sarah blushed.

I blushed too.

Mama said: "**Slow is fine, but not so slow you die of old age.**"

> "Mama said life is like a box of chocolates. But in Silicon Valley, that box might be stock options, or it might be a bankruptcy notice."
>
> "Either way, as long as I can go back to Baton Rouge for a bowl of Gumbo, with the right person, there's still hope."
>
> — Silicon Jim, from Louisiana
