# Preface: Why The Art of War?

---

> "The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected."
>
> — Sun Tzu, *The Art of War*

## A Conversation Across 2,500 Years

Around 500 BC, Sun Wu wrote *The Art of War* in the Kingdom of Wu.

In 1949, Benjamin Graham published the first edition of *The Intelligent Investor*.

Separated by 25 centuries, these two minds addressed the same fundamental question:

**How to make sound decisions in the face of uncertainty.**

## The Common Ground of War and Investing

| War | Investing |
|-----|-----------|
| Limited resources | Limited capital |
| Incomplete information | Information asymmetry |
| Opponents adapt | Markets price in |
| Costly failures | Painful losses |
| Requires long-term planning | Demands patience |

Both are **the science of allocating limited resources under uncertainty**.

## Why Graham Isn't Enough

Graham's value investing theory is brilliant, but it has limitations:

1. **Heavy on "Method," light on "Dao"** — Great quantitative criteria, but lacking strategic depth
2. **Defensive focus** — Margin of Safety is defense; when do we attack?
3. **Weak on psychology** — Formulas don't fix human nature

Sun Tzu fills these gaps:

| Graham's Strengths | Sun Tzu's Additions |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| P/E, P/B quantitative metrics | Five Factors holistic assessment |
| Margin of Safety | "First make yourself invincible" strategy |
| Diversification | Orthodox/Unorthodox dynamic allocation |
| — | Timing and the art of offense |
| — | Psychological discipline |

## Before We Begin

Before investing, do your homework.

Turn the page. Let's begin our "temple calculations."
