# Chapter 3: Five Keys to Victory — Graham's Stock Selection Criteria

---

> "Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. He will win whose generals are able and not interfered with by the sovereign."
>
> — Sun Tzu, *The Art of War*

## Sun Tzu's Five Keys to Victory

Sun Tzu identified five ways to know if victory is achievable:

| Key to Victory | Original Meaning | Investment Mapping |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Know when to fight** | Know when to engage, when to retreat | Know when to buy, when to sell |
| **Handle superior/inferior forces** | Know how to deploy troops | Know how to size positions |
| **Same spirit throughout ranks** | Unity of purpose | Management-shareholder alignment |
| **Prepared vs unprepared** | Ready vs not ready | With margin of safety vs without |
| **Able general, no interference** | Capable leadership with autonomy | Competent management with independence |

---

## Graham's Five Stock Selection Criteria

Benjamin Graham's criteria from *The Intelligent Investor* perfectly align with Sun Tzu's five keys:

| Key to Victory | Graham Criterion | Specific Metric |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Know when to fight | **Reasonable Valuation** | P/E < 15, P/B < 1.5 |
| Handle forces | **Adequate Size** | Revenue > $100M |
| Same spirit | **Dividend Record** | Continuous dividends > 20 years |
| Prepared vs unprepared | **Financial Strength** | Current Ratio > 2 |
| Able general | **Earnings Stability** | No losses in 10 years |

---

## I. Know When to Fight — Reasonable Valuation

### Original Text

> "He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight."

### Graham's Wisdom

> "Buy well, and you're halfway to success."

### Valuation Standards

| Metric | Graham Standard | Aggressive | Conservative |
|--------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| **P/E Ratio** | < 15 | < 20 | < 12 |
| **P/B Ratio** | < 1.5 | < 2.0 | < 1.0 |
| **P/E × P/B** | < 22.5 | < 30 | < 15 |
| **Dividend Yield** | > 2/3 AAA bond yield | > 2% | > 3% |

### When NOT to Fight

Never buy in these situations:

| Situation | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| P/E > 25 | Overvalued, insufficient margin |
| P/B > 3 | Excessive market expectations |
| Can't understand business | "Never invest in what you don't understand" |
| Market euphoria | Possible top |

### Case: March 2000 vs March 2009

| Metric | March 2000 | March 2009 |
|--------|------------|------------|
| S&P 500 P/E | 44 | 13 |
| Should fight? | ❌ Absolutely not | ✅ Perfect time |
| Next 10-year return | -30% | +300% |

---

## II. Handle Superior and Inferior Forces — Size and Position

### Original Text

> "He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces."

### Graham's Wisdom

> "Don't put all eggs in one basket, but don't use too many baskets either."

### Size Standards

| Type | Revenue Scale | Risk Level | Allocation |
|------|---------------|------------|------------|
| **Large Cap** | > $10B | Low | 60-70% |
| **Mid Cap** | $1B-10B | Medium | 20-30% |
| **Small Cap** | < $1B | High | 10-20% |

### Position Sizing Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Diversified but not excessive** | 20-30 stocks is sufficient |
| **Single stock limit** | Any single stock < 5% |
| **Sector limit** | Any single sector < 25% |
| **Cash reserve** | Keep at least 10-20% in cash |

### Sun Tzu's Orthodox and Unorthodox

| Type | Investment Equivalent | Characteristics |
|------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Orthodox (正兵)** | Core holdings (60-70%) | Stable, long-term hold |
| **Unorthodox (奇兵)** | Opportunity positions (20-30%) | More aggressive, tactical |
| **Reserve (预备队)** | Cash (10-20%) | Wait for opportunities |

---

## III. Same Spirit Throughout Ranks — Dividend Record & Governance

### Original Text

> "He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks."

### Graham's Wisdom

> "A company with 20+ years of continuous dividends shows management's willingness to share profits with shareholders."

### Dividend Standards

| Metric | Graham Standard | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Consecutive dividend years | > 20 years | Proven stable business model |
| Payout ratio | 30-50% | Too high unsustainable, too low stingy |
| Dividend growth | > Inflation | Real purchasing power increase |

### Dividend Aristocrats

S&P 500 companies with 25+ years of consecutive dividend increases:

| Company | Consecutive Years | Current Yield |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Johnson & Johnson | 61 years | ~3% |
| Coca-Cola | 61 years | ~3% |
| Procter & Gamble | 67 years | ~2.5% |
| 3M | 65 years | ~5% |

### Red Flags 🚩

- Sudden dividend cut or suspension
- Payout ratio > 80% (may be unsustainable)
- Borrowing to pay dividends
- Simultaneous reduction in buybacks and dividends

---

## IV. Prepared vs Unprepared — Financial Strength

### Original Text

> "He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared."

### Graham's Wisdom

> "The first layer of margin of safety is a strong balance sheet."

### Financial Strength Standards

| Metric | Graham Standard | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **Current Ratio** | > 2 | Strong short-term solvency |
| **Quick Ratio** | > 1 | Adequate liquidity |
| **Debt Ratio** | < 50% | Long-term financial safety |
| **Interest Coverage** | > 3x | Manageable debt burden |

### Three Layers of "Prepared"

```
Layer 1: Cash Buffer
└── Covers 6-12 months of operating expenses

Layer 2: Asset Cushion
└── Liquid assets > Short-term liabilities

Layer 3: Credit Backup
└── Unused bank credit facilities
```

### Case: 2008 Financial Crisis

| Company | 2008 Financial Status | Result |
|---------|----------------------|--------|
| **Apple** | $25B cash, zero debt | Sailed through, quick recovery |
| **Lehman** | 30:1 leverage, short-term debt dependent | Bankruptcy |
| **Berkshire** | $20B+ cash | Bottom-fished Goldman Sachs |

**Lesson**: "Prepared vs unprepared" — prepared companies survived.

## V. Able General, No Interference — Earnings Stability

### Original Text

> "He will win whose generals are able and not interfered with by the sovereign."

### Graham's Wisdom

> "A stable earnings record indicates lasting competitive advantage."

### Earnings Stability Standards

| Metric | Graham Standard | Advanced Standard |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Profitable Years** | No losses in 10 years | 20+ years profitable |
| **Earnings Growth** | Positive | > Inflation + GDP |
| **ROE Stability** | No wild swings | Std Dev < 5% |
| **Gross Margin Trend** | Stable or rising | Not declining |

### Earnings Quality Assessment

| Dimension | Good Signal | Warning Signal |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Cash Conversion** | Operating CF ≥ Net Income | Operating CF < Net Income |
| **Revenue Quality** | Stable core business | Dependent on non-recurring items |
| **Receivables** | Turnover improving | Turnover declining |
| **Inventory** | Stable turnover | Significant buildup |

### Case: Kodak vs Johnson & Johnson

| Dimension | Kodak (1990s-2000s) | J&J |
|-----------|---------------------|-----|
| Consecutive Profits | Started losing post-2000 | 100+ years profitable |
| Gross Margin | Declining yearly | Stable at 65%+ |
| Cash Flow | Deteriorating | Consistently strong |
| Outcome | 2012 bankruptcy | Continuous dividend growth |
