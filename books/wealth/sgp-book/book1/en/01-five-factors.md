## Sun Tzu's Five Factors

Sun Tzu identified five factors that determine victory:

| Factor | Original Meaning | Investment Mapping |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Dao** | Unity between ruler and people | Governance · Shareholder alignment |
| **Heaven** | Weather, seasons, timing | Macro environment · Market cycles |
| **Earth** | Terrain, distance, difficulty | Competitive landscape · Moats |
| **Commander** | Wisdom, sincerity, courage | Management · Leadership |
| **Method** | Organization, logistics | Financial structure · Operations |

---

## I. Dao — Governance & Alignment

### Original Text

> "The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger."

### Investment Interpretation

**Dao** in investing asks: **Are management's interests aligned with shareholders?**

### Assessment Framework

| Indicator | Good Signs | Red Flags 🚩 |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Insider ownership | > 5% | Near 0% |
| Compensation | Tied to long-term results | High pay regardless |
| Capital allocation | Buybacks at fair value | Buybacks to prop stock |
| Related transactions | Rare or none | Frequent self-dealing |
| Communication | Admits mistakes | Always makes excuses |

### Graham's View

> "Investors should observe whether management treats shareholders as partners or as ATMs."

### Case Study: Berkshire vs Enron

| Aspect | Berkshire | Enron |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Insider ownership | Buffett ~16% | Executives cashing out |
| CEO salary | $100,000/year | Tens of millions |
| Communication | Candid annual letters | Always bullish PPTs |
| Outcome | 60 years of compounding | Bankruptcy |

## II. Heaven — Macro Cycles

### Original Text

> "Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons."

### Investment Interpretation

**Heaven** asks: **What macro environment are we in?**

### Key Cycles

| Cycle Type | Factors | How to Assess |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **Economic** | GDP, employment, inflation | Leading Indicators |
| **Interest Rate** | Fed policy | Fed Watch Tool |
| **Industry** | Supply/demand, technology | Inventory, capacity utilization |
| **Sentiment** | Fear and greed | VIX, CNN Fear & Greed Index |

### Howard Marks on Cycles

> "You can't predict cycles, but you can prepare for them."

| Cycle Phase | Characteristics | Strategy |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| Bottom | Fear everywhere, low valuations | Buy aggressively |
| Recovery | Climbing wall of worry | Hold |
| Boom | Optimism rising | Gradually reduce |
| Top | Peak greed | Play defense |
| Decline | Panic selling | Prepare ammunition |

### Case: March 2000 vs March 2009

| Metric | March 2000 | March 2009 |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Shiller P/E | 44 | 13 |
| VIX | 24 | 50+ |
| Headlines | "New economy forever" | "End of the world" |
| Next 10 years | -50%+ | +300%+ |

## III. Earth — Competitive Moats

### Original Text

> "Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes."

### Investment Interpretation

**Earth** asks: **How deep is the competitive advantage?**

### Buffett's Moat Framework

| Moat Type | Description | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Brand** | Consumer recognition premium | Coca-Cola, Apple |
| **Network Effects** | More users = more value | Visa, Meta |
| **Switching Costs** | Too painful to change | Adobe, Salesforce |
| **Cost Advantage** | Scale or geographic | Walmart, Costco |
| **Patents/Regulation** | Legal protection | Pharma, utilities |

### Moat Depth Scoring

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 5 | Nearly indestructible | Visa payment network |
| 4 | Very strong | Apple ecosystem |
| 3 | Moderate | Typical consumer brand |
| 2 | Weak | Easily replicated |
| 1 | Almost none | Pure commodity |

### Case: Kodak vs Apple

| Aspect | Kodak (1990s) | Apple (2020s) |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Moat | Film chemistry patents | Ecosystem + Brand |
| Threat | Digital cameras | Android |
| Response | Denial | Continuous innovation |
| Outcome | Bankruptcy | $3T market cap |

**Lesson**: Moats must adapt to change, or they become "death ground."

## IV. Commander — Management Assessment

### Original Text

> "The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness."

### Investment Interpretation

Evaluate management across five dimensions:

| Virtue | Meaning | Assessment Question |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **Wisdom** | Strategic vision | Can they see industry trends? |
| **Sincerity** | Trustworthiness | Do they keep promises? |
| **Benevolence** | Care for people | How satisfied are employees? |
| **Courage** | Decision-making | Do they act decisively in crisis? |
| **Strictness** | Discipline | Are costs well-controlled? |

### Philip Fisher's "Scuttlebutt" Method

> "By chatting with employees, suppliers, and competitors, you learn management's true character."

**People to ask**:
- Former employees (most honest)
- Suppliers (do they pay on time?)
- Competitors (who do they fear?)
- Industry analysts

### Case Study: Jeff Bezos

| Virtue | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Wisdom | "Your margin is my opportunity" — saw retail disruption 20 years early |
| Sincerity | Shareholder letters promised long-term focus; delivered for 20+ years |
| Benevolence | Controversial (high pressure), but created massive employment |
| Courage | Bold entry into cloud (AWS), transformed the industry |
| Strictness | Famous "two-pizza team" rule, keeps teams lean |

---

## V. Method — Financial Health

### Original Text

> "By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army, the gradations of rank, and the maintenance of roads."

### Investment Interpretation

**Method** asks: **Is the financial structure sound?**

### Graham's Safety Metrics

| Metric | Standard | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Current Ratio | > 2 | Short-term solvency |
| Debt Ratio | < 50% | Long-term stability |
| Interest Coverage | > 3x | Debt safety cushion |
| Consecutive Profits | > 10 years | Business model proven |
| Consecutive Dividends | > 20 years | Cash flow quality |

### Modern Supplemental Metrics

| Metric | Excellent | Adequate | Danger |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| FCF/Net Income | > 80% | 50-80% | < 50% |
| A/R Turnover | Improving | Stable | Deteriorating |
| Operating Cash Flow | Consistently positive | Occasionally negative | Often negative |

### Case: Financial Warning Signs

**Evergrande (2021)** red flags:
- Debt ratio > 80%
- Payables ballooning (owed suppliers)
- Cash flow dependent on presales
- Complex related-party transactions

**Outcome**: Debt default, stock worthless.
