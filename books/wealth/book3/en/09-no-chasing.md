# Chapter 9: Don't Chase Highs, Don't Sell Lows

> "Sarah said: You always buy at the top and sell at the bottom. That's called chasing highs and selling lows."

## The Story

Mike's investment history:

| Year | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2000 | Bought internet stocks at the top | Lost |
| 2007 | Bought Manhattan apartment at the top | Lost 40% |
| 2021 | Son bought Zoom at the top | Tuition gone |

Mike's pattern:

1. See something going up, buy it
2. See something going down, sell it
3. Repeat

**This is called chasing highs and selling lows. It's the most reliable way to lose money.**

## Why Chasing Leads to Losses

Human instinct:

- See it rising → Think it will keep rising → Buy
- See it falling → Think it will keep falling → Sell

But market patterns:

- Goes up too much → Will drop
- Goes down too much → Will rise

**Your instincts are the opposite of market patterns.**

## The Rules

### Rule 1: When Everyone's Talking About It, Don't Buy

When you hear everyone discussing a stock:

- 2000: Pets.com
- 2020: Zoom
- 2021: GameStop
- 2021: Dogecoin
- 2024: Nvidia (be careful)

**By the time you hear about it, it's usually too late.**

### Rule 2: When There's a Crash, Don't Sell

When headlines are all panic:

- 2008: Financial crisis
- 2020: COVID crash
- 2022: Tech stock crash

**This is usually an opportunity, not time to run.**

### Rule 3: Replace Emotion with System

Don't make decisions based on feelings. Use rules:

```
Buy rules:
- DCA $X every month
- Regardless of ups or downs
- Execute automatically

Sell rules:
- Only sell when you need the money
- Only sell when investment thesis changes
- Don't sell because of price movements
```

## Self-Check: Are You Chasing Highs and Selling Lows?

Ask yourself these questions:

| Question | If yes, you might be chasing |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Did you buy after seeing it go up? | ✓ |
| Do you want to sell after seeing it drop? | ✓ |
| Did you buy because friends were buying? | ✓ |
| Did you sell because news said crash coming? | ✓ |
| Do you regret not buying earlier after it rose? | ✓ |
| Do you regret not selling earlier after it dropped? | ✓ |

**If 2 or more are "yes," you need to change your strategy.**

## How to Change

### Method 1: Dollar-Cost Average

Fixed amount every month, regardless of ups or downs.

**Take decision-making power away from emotions.**

### Method 2: Don't Watch the News

Financial news exists to grab eyeballs, not to make you money.

**Delete finance apps.**

### Method 3: Keep an Investment Journal

Before every buy/sell, write:

- Why am I buying/selling?
- What's my emotion right now?
- Is this a system decision or impulse?

**Force yourself to think.**

## One Line

> **The market rewards discipline and punishes impulse.**

- [ ] I don't buy just because "everyone is buying"
