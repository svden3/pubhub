# Chapter 30: Silicon Valley Asian Anxiety

> **Mom said: "Son, you don't need to be someone else's pride. You just need to be yourself."**

## "Where Did Your Son Get In?"

Every April, Silicon Valley's Chinese community has a fixed ritual:

College decisions come out.

```
WeChat groups:
"Congrats to David's mom! Stanford!"
"Congrats to Lisa's mom! MIT!"
"Congrats to Kevin's mom! UC Berkeley!"

Then silence.

Parents whose kids didn't get into top 20 schools quietly leave the group.
```

This is Silicon Valley Asian anxiety.

## Sources of Anxiety

### 1. The Cost of Immigration

```
First-generation immigrants' thinking:

"I gave up everything in my home country to come to America,
all for my children's better education.

If my children don't succeed,
my sacrifice was meaningless."

This pressure transfers to the children.
```

### 2. Comparison Culture

```
Unspoken rules in Chinese communities:

- Children are parents' "report cards"
- Child's university = Parent's reputation
- Child's career = Family's status

"What company does your kid work at?"
"Oh, Google."
"Mine's at Meta."

Comparison everywhere.
```

### 3. The Narrow Gate to Success

```
"Success" in Asian parents' eyes:

1. Doctor
2. Lawyer
3. Engineer (FAANG)
4. Finance (Wall Street)

Anything else = Failure

Artist? No.
Teacher? Too poor.
Startup? Too risky.
Social worker? No future.
```

## The Cost of Anxiety

### For Children

```
Common problems:

1. Depression and anxiety
   - Asian teen mental health issues are high
   - But help-seeking rates are lowest ("shameful")

2. Don't know what they want
   - Scheduled from childhood
   - Lost after reaching college

3. Broken parent-child relationships
   - The feeling of "I'm not good enough"
   - Avoiding parents

4. Imposter syndrome
   - Feel undeserving even when successful
   - Never good enough
```

### For Parents

```
1. Constant anxiety
   - Preschool anxiety → Elementary
   - Elementary anxiety → Middle
   - Middle anxiety → High school
   - High school anxiety → College
   - College anxiety → Job
   - Job anxiety → Marriage

2. Marriage stress
   - Different parenting philosophies
   - Financial pressure
   - All time goes to children

3. Missing the present
   - Childhood flashes by
   - Only remember carpooling and homework
```

### The Home of Christ Lesson

In 2022, a Silicon Valley Chinese church accepted an $8 million donation from a THC (cannabis) entrepreneur.

What should have been a blessing became a disaster:

```
What happened:

1. Large donation from controversial source
2. Church leadership split
3. Congregation trust collapsed
4. Pastor resigned
5. Church split

Lesson:

- Money can destroy community
- Success isn't just about numbers
- Means matter as much as ends
- Anxiously chasing "big" can lose "real"
```

**The metaphor of this story:**

When we're too anxious about "success"—whether our children's college or our church's size—we may lose what truly matters.

## Data Speaks

### Asian Mental Health

```
CDC data (2023):

Asian teenagers:
- Suicidal ideation: Among the highest of all races
- Help-seeking: Lowest of all races
- Discussing mental health with parents: Least

Reasons:
- Cultural shame ("having problems" = losing face)
- Language barriers (parents don't understand)
- High expectations + Low support
```

### The Success Paradox

```
Pew Research (2023):

Asians in America:
- Educational attainment: Highest
- Household income: Highest
- Career achievement: Very high

But also:
- Workplace glass ceiling (low exec representation)
- Mental health issues
- Happiness not necessarily highest

"Successful"—but happy?
```

## Redefining Success

### Mom's Definition

I asked Mom: "Do you think I'm successful?"

She said:

> "Son, you're healthy, you're kind, you have friends.
>
> You have a place to live, food to eat, people who love you.
>
> You come see me on Sundays, eat with me.
>
> **In my eyes, you're already very successful.**
>
> I never required you to go to Harvard.
> I only required you to be a good person."

### Sarah's Definition

> "I worked at Google for 16 years.
>
> My colleagues thought I was successful: high salary, stock, financial freedom.
>
> But what am I most proud of?
>
> **My daughter loves drawing, and I let her draw.**
> **She didn't get into Stanford, went to a regular college.**
> **But she's happy every day.**
>
> For me, that's success."

### An Alternative Success Checklist

```
NOT:
□ Child got into Ivy League
□ Child earns seven figures
□ Child bought a big house

BUT:
□ Child is physically and mentally healthy
□ Child knows who they are
□ Child can handle failure
□ Child still wants to talk to you
□ Child has real friends
□ Child can live independently
□ Child is kind and honest
```

## How to Reduce Anxiety

### 1. Limit Information

```
Reduce anxiety sources:

- Leave mom groups (or mute them)
- Stop reading "other people's kids" posts
- Don't ask "where did your kid get in"
- Focus on your own family
```

### 2. Redefine Goals

```
NOT: Get child into Top 20
BUT: Help child become a healthy, independent adult

NOT: Have child earn lots of money
BUT: Help child find meaningful work

NOT: Have child bring me glory
BUT: Let child become themselves
```

### 3. Accept "Good Enough"

```
Good Enough Parenting:

Don't need perfect parents.
Don't need perfect children.
Don't need perfect university.
Don't need perfect life.

"Good enough" is enough.
```

### 4. Self-Growth

```
The best education is example:

If you want your child to:
- Not be anxious → You stop being anxious first
- Love learning → You love learning first
- Be confident → You be confident first
- Accept failure → You accept failure first

Your state = Your child's ceiling
```
