# Chapter 26: Healthcare Is Hidden Wealth

## Sarah's Math Lesson (Continued)

In 2020, Sarah was 48 years old, preparing to retire.

"Wait," I said, "you're only 48. Medicare starts at 65. What about those 17 years in between?"

Sarah pulled out a piece of paper:

```
Healthcare options for ages 48-65:

Option 1: COBRA (continue employer insurance after leaving)
- $2,200/month (family)
- Only lasts 18 months
- Too expensive

Option 2: ACA (Obamacare)
- $800-1,500/month (depending on income and subsidies)
- Can use until age 65
- This is my choice

Option 3: Spouse's Insurance
- If spouse is still working
- Most cost-effective option
```

"**Healthcare is the biggest barrier to early retirement.** Many people aren't lacking money to retire—they're afraid to retire without insurance."

## Employer Insurance: Silicon Valley's Hidden Benefit

### Why Big Company Insurance Is So Good

**Google's healthcare (Sarah's example):**

```
Google employee health benefits:

- Premium: Company pays 90%+, employee pays very little
- Deductible: $500 or less
- Out-of-pocket maximum: $3,000
- Includes: Dental, vision, mental health
- Extras: Gym, massage, nutrition counseling

Annual value: $20,000-30,000 (if buying yourself)
```

**This is hidden salary.**

Many people only look at base salary, forgetting how much healthcare benefits are worth.

---

### Small Company vs Big Company

| Item | Big Company (Google) | Small/Startup |
|------|---------------------|---------------|
| Premium split | Company 90%+ | Company 50-70% |
| Deductible | $500 | $2,000-5,000 |
| Network | PPO (free choice) | HMO (restricted) |
| Extra benefits | Many | Few |

**Mike's lesson:**

> "I joined a startup, got a 20% raise.
> But insurance changed from PPO to High Deductible.
> First year, my son was hospitalized. Out of pocket: $8,000.
> That 20% raise disappeared."

---

## HSA: The Triple Tax-Free Super Account

### What Is an HSA

**Health Savings Account**

Only available with High Deductible Health Plans (HDHP).

### Triple Tax-Free

```
HSA superpowers:

1. Tax-free deposits    — Deducted from pre-tax income
2. Tax-free growth      — Investment gains not taxed
3. Tax-free withdrawals — Medical expenses not taxed

This is the ONLY "triple tax-free" account in US tax code.
Better than 401k (withdrawals taxed).
Better than Roth IRA (deposits taxed).
```

### 2024 Limits

| Type | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Individual | $4,150 |
| Family | $8,300 |
| Age 55+ catch-up | +$1,000 |

### The Hidden Retirement Account

**Sarah's HSA strategy:**

> "I don't use my HSA to pay current medical bills.
> I pay with cash, keep the receipts.
> HSA money goes entirely into index funds.
>
> In 20 years, this money grows tax-free.
> After 65, can be used for any expense (non-medical pays normal tax, no penalty).
>
> **HSA is a stealth Super Roth IRA.**"

## ACA (Obamacare): Early Retirement's Best Friend

### What Is ACA

**Affordable Care Act**, passed in 2010.

Core rules:
- Cannot deny coverage for pre-existing conditions
- Must cover essential health services
- Subsidies for low income

### How Subsidies Work

```
ACA subsidy rules (2024):

Your income vs Federal Poverty Level (FPL)

Income < 150% FPL  →  Pay max 0-2% of income
Income 150-200% FPL →  Pay max 2-4% of income
Income 200-250% FPL →  Pay max 4-6% of income
Income 250-400% FPL →  Pay max 6-8.5% of income
Income > 400% FPL  →  Currently no cap (may change in 2025)

2024 FPL (48 states):
- Individual: $15,060
- 2-person family: $20,440
- 4-person family: $31,200
```

### The Key to Early Retirement

**Sarah's approach:**

```
When retiring in 2020:

Google stock: Mostly long-term capital gains
Sell a little each year: Keep around $60,000
Family income: $60,000 (about 192% FPL)

ACA premium (2-person family):
- Market price: $1,800/month
- After subsidy: $400/month

Annual savings: $16,800
```

**Key technique: Control AGI (Adjusted Gross Income)**

- Stock sales count as capital gains
- 401k withdrawals count as income
- Roth IRA withdrawals don't count as income

"**Roth IRA is early retirement's best friend. Withdrawals don't count as income, don't affect ACA subsidies.**"

## Medicare: The Gift at 65

### Four Parts

```
Medicare structure:

Part A (Hospital)
- Free for most people (worked 10+ years)
- Covers: Hospital, nursing facility, hospice
- Has deductibles and copays

Part B (Outpatient)
- $174.70/month (2024 standard)
- Higher for high earners (IRMAA surcharge)
- Covers: Doctors, tests, outpatient surgery

Part C (Medicare Advantage)
- Offered by private insurers
- Combines A + B + usually D
- May have extra benefits (dental, vision)

Part D (Prescription drugs)
- Buy separately or included in Part C
- Different plans cover different drugs
```

### IRMAA: The High-Income Penalty

**Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount**

```
2024 IRMAA thresholds (individual):

Income ≤ $103,000        →  Part B: $174.70
$103,000 - $129,000      →  Part B: $244.60
$129,000 - $161,000      →  Part B: $349.40
$161,000 - $193,000      →  Part B: $454.20
$193,000 - $500,000      →  Part B: $559.00
> $500,000               →  Part B: $594.00

Part D also has similar surcharges.
```

**Note: Uses income from 2 years ago!**

Sarah:
> "I retired from Google in 2020, sold a lot of stock that year.
> In 2022, I turned 65. Medicare used my 2020 income.
> Part B premium went from $170 to over $500.
>
> **Lesson: Plan your income carefully for the two years before Medicare.**"

## Dental and Vision: The Forgotten Corners

### The Problem

Medicare does NOT cover:
- Routine dental
- Routine vision (eye exams, glasses)
- Hearing aids

These require separate insurance or out-of-pocket.

### Solutions

```
Option 1: Buy separate dental/vision insurance
- $30-50/month
- Limited coverage, mainly preventive

Option 2: Medicare Advantage (Part C)
- Many plans include dental/vision
- Read carefully when choosing

Option 3: Pay out of pocket
- Two cleanings per year: $200-400
- Eye exam + glasses: $300-500
- Might be cheaper than premiums

Option 4: Dental schools
- 50-70% cheaper
- But requires time and patience
```

---

## Long-Term Care: The Biggest Hidden Risk

### The Numbers

```
Long-term care costs (2024):

Nursing Home
- National average: $9,000/month
- California: $12,000/month
- New York: $14,000/month

Assisted Living
- National average: $4,500/month

Home Care
- $25-35/hour
- Full-time: $8,000-12,000/month

Probability of needing long-term care:
- Over 65: ~70% will need some form
- Average duration: Women 3.7 years, Men 2.2 years
```

**Medicare does NOT cover long-term care!**

Only covers short-term rehab (max 100 days).

### Options

```
Option 1: Long-term care insurance (LTCI)
- Best to buy at age 50-60
- Premiums increase with age
- Insurance companies may raise rates or go bankrupt

Option 2: Self-insure
- Assume needing $300,000-500,000
- Keep in separate account

Option 3: Medicaid (last resort)
- Must "spend down" assets
- Only qualify with under $2,000
- Limited choices

Option 4: Hybrid insurance
- Life insurance + long-term care
- If unused, passes to heirs
```

**Mom's attitude:**

> "Son, I don't want to go to a nursing home.
> I want to leave from my own home.
> Just hire someone for me."

## Medical Tourism: Silicon Valley's Secret

### Why

US healthcare costs are the highest in the world.

```
Same surgery:

Knee replacement:
- USA: $50,000
- Mexico: $12,000
- Thailand: $10,000
- India: $7,000

Dental implant (single):
- USA: $5,000
- Mexico: $1,500
- Costa Rica: $1,000
```

### Sarah's Experience

> "I went to Mexico for dental work.
> Los Algodones, a border town.
> There are 300+ dental clinics there.
>
> Four crowns + cleaning: $2,000
> US quote: $8,000
>
> The dentist graduated from a US dental school.
> Equipment was imported from Germany.
> Only difference was the price."

### Precautions

- Do your research (reviews, certifications)
- Think twice about complex surgeries
- Factor in travel costs
- Consider post-procedure care

## Health Is the Greatest Wealth

### Mike's Story

In 2018, Mike was 52.

His checkup revealed: Type 2 diabetes.

```
Mike's annual medical bills:

Medication: $3,000
Tests: $1,500
Specialists: $2,000
Total: $6,500/year

What if he'd started exercising 10 years ago?
```

**Mom said:**

> "Son, gym membership is $50/month.
> Diabetes medication is $300/month.
> You do the math."

### Prevention vs Treatment

```
Return on investing in health:

Exercise (30 minutes daily)
- Cost: $0-50/month
- Return: Lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer

Healthy eating
- Cost: Maybe 20% more than junk food
- Return: Lower medical expenses

Annual checkup
- Cost: Usually fully covered by insurance
- Return: Early detection, early treatment

This is true "investing."
```
