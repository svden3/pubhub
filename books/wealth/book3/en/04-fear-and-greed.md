# Chapter 4: Be Greedy When Others Are Fearful

> "Sarah said: Fear is the best buy signal."

## The Story

September 2008. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.

The whole world was panicking.

Sarah called me:

"Jim, how much cash do you have?"

"About $150,000."

"Now is the time to buy stocks."

"Are you crazy? The world is ending!"

"**The world isn't ending. Fear is the best buy signal.**"

I used $100,000 to buy an S&P 500 index fund. It was at 1,200 points.

In March 2009, it dropped to 666 points. My $100,000 became $55,000.

I added another $50,000.

In 2024, the S&P 500 exceeded 5,000 points.

**That $150,000 became over $600,000.**

## The Rules

### Rule 1: Be Greedy When Others Are Fearful, Fearful When Others Are Greedy

This is Buffett's most famous quote.

It means:

- **Everyone is selling** → Consider buying
- **Everyone is buying** → Consider selling

### Rule 2: But First, You Need Cash

Sarah said: "**Be greedy when others are fearful. But first you need the capital to be greedy — cash.**"

If you don't have cash, you can only watch when the market drops.

So always keep 10-20% in cash.

### Rule 3: Signs of Fear

When you see these, the market is fearful:

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Headlines are all bad news | "Stock market crashes!" |
| Your friends are all selling | "I've sold everything" |
| Experts say "this time is different" | "The economy is finished" |
| VIX fear index > 40 | Extreme panic |

## How to Do It

### The Simple Way

Don't try to guess when there's fear or greed.

Use **dollar-cost averaging**:

- Buy a fixed amount every month
- Regardless of whether the market is up or down
- Automatically "buy more when it drops, buy less when it rises"

### The Advanced Way

When the market drops significantly (> 20%):

1. Check: Is this temporary panic, or is something really wrong with the company/economy?
2. If it's temporary panic: Use your cash reserves to buy more
3. Don't go all in at once — buy in batches
