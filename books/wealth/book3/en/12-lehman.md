# Chapter 12: Too Big to Fail Still Fails

> **2008 Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy**

---

## What Happened

September 14, 2008. Sunday night.

Mike called me:

"Jim, Bear Stearns was already bought by JPMorgan. Now I'm at Lehman Brothers."

"That's good."

"Tomorrow it might be gone."

"What do you mean?"

"We can't find a buyer. The government won't save us."

Monday, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy.

158 years of history. Gone overnight.

**The global financial crisis officially began.**

## Background

### What Was the Subprime Crisis

1. Banks gave loans to people who couldn't repay
2. Packaged these loans as "financial products" and sold them to investors
3. When house prices went up, everyone made money
4. When house prices dropped... everyone was ruined

### Why Lehman Fell

Lehman held massive amounts of subprime-related products.

House prices dropped, these products became worthless.

The government chose not to save Lehman.

**158 years of history, disappeared in 48 hours.**

## Mike's Story

After Enron, Mike went to Lehman.

"Wall Street is real finance! A century-old firm!"

He used all his bonus to buy a Manhattan apartment.

"House prices always go up, this is New York!"

In 2008, he lost his job. The apartment lost 40%.

He showed up at my door again.

Sarah said: "Mike, you made the same mistake again."

"I know. Put all my money in one place again."

"Not just that. **You always buy at the top and sell at the bottom. That's called chasing highs and selling lows.**"

## The Lessons

### Lesson 1: Too Big to Fail Still Fails

| "Can't Fail" Things | Result |
|---------------------|--------|
| Enron | Failed |
| Lehman Brothers | Failed |
| Silicon Valley Bank | Failed |

**Nothing is absolutely safe.**

### Lesson 2: The Government Won't Always Save You

After Lehman, the government saved AIG, saved the banks.

But Lehman itself wasn't saved.

**Don't bet your fate on "the government will save us."**

### Lesson 3: Crisis Is Opportunity

In 2008, Sarah told me to buy index funds.

"Now is the time to buy stocks."

"Are you crazy? The world is ending!"

"**The world isn't ending. Fear is the best buy signal.**"

I bought. 15 years later, it grew more than 4x.

## What to Do During a Crisis

### If You Have Cash

1. **Don't panic sell** — Locking in losses is the stupidest thing
2. **Consider buying more** — If you believe the economy will recover
3. **Buy in batches** — Don't go all in at once

### If You Don't Have Cash

1. **Protect your job** — Cash flow is more important than investment returns
2. **Don't borrow to invest** — That's gambling
3. **Wait** — The next opportunity will come

## One Line

> **Too big to fail just means it falls slower, not that it won't fall.**

## Checklist

- [ ] I don't believe in any "absolutely safe" investment
- [ ] I've diversified, not put all money in one place
- [ ] I have cash reserves to buy during crises
- [ ] I won't sell in a panic
