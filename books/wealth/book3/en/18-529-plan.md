## What Is a 529 Plan

A 529 plan is a U.S. education savings account.

**Simply put: Money invested grows and is withdrawn tax-free when used for education.**

| Feature | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Federal tax | Growth and withdrawals are tax-free (when used for education) |
| State tax | Many states offer additional tax deductions |
| Uses | Tuition, room and board, books, computers |
| Restrictions | Can only be used for education, otherwise there's a penalty |

## Why Use a 529

### Example

Suppose you save $500/month for your child for 18 years:

| Account Type | Value After 18 Years | Notes |
|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| Regular investment account | ~$190,000 | Subject to capital gains tax |
| 529 account | ~$220,000 | All tax-free |

**Difference: $30,000**

This is the power of tax advantages.

## How to Open a 529

### Step 1: Choose a State

You can open any state's 529, but some states give extra tax deductions to residents.

| Your State | Recommendation |
|------------|----------------|
| State with tax deduction | Open your state's 529 |
| No state tax (e.g., Texas) | Choose lowest fees (e.g., Utah, Nevada) |
| Minimal state deduction | Choose best investment options |

### Step 2: Open the Account

1. Go to the state's 529 official website
2. Fill in information (you are the account holder, child is beneficiary)
3. Choose an investment portfolio (recommended: Target Date Fund)
4. Set up automatic transfers

### Step 3: DCA Monthly

Set up an automatic transfer:

- Payday → Auto-transfer $X to 529
- Don't think, don't watch, let it grow

## FAQ

### Q: What if my child doesn't go to college?

Three options:

1. **Transfer to another family member** — Siblings, nieces/nephews, or even yourself
2. **Use for K-12 private school** — Up to $10,000/year
3. **Withdraw and pay penalty** — 10% penalty + back taxes (not recommended)

### Q: How much should I save?

| School Type | Estimated 4-Year Cost (2025) | Monthly DCA for 18 Years |
|-------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Public (in-state) | $100,000 | ~$300/month |
| Public (out-of-state) | $180,000 | ~$550/month |
| Private | $320,000 | ~$950/month |

**You don't need to save the full amount. There's financial aid, scholarships, student loans.**

Save what you can, don't stress.

### Q: Does it affect financial aid?

529 accounts have minimal impact on financial aid calculations.

Parent-owned 529s count for only about 5.64%.

Not a big impact.

## The Rules

### Rule 1: Start Early

Compound interest needs time.

Open a 529 when your child is born. Don't wait.

### Rule 2: Automate

Set up monthly automatic transfers.

Don't rely on willpower.

### Rule 3: Choose Low Fees

529s also have fee differences.

Choose ones with fees < 0.5%.

### Rule 4: Keep Investment Simple

Choose a "Target Date Fund."

Child starting college in 2042? Choose the "2042 Target Date" fund.

**Automatically adjusts risk. Set it and forget it.**
