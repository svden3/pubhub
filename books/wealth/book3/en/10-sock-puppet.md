# Chapter 10: The Sock Puppet Lesson

> **The 2000 Dot-Com Bubble**

---

## What Happened

In 2000, internet companies were everywhere.

Pets.com sold dog food. Its mascot was a sock puppet.

The company went public. The stock price soared.

The airport bus driver sold his house to buy internet stocks. He said: "Pets.com is going to the moon!"

In March 2000, the NASDAQ hit 5,000 points.

In April, it started falling.

Pets.com went bankrupt. The CEO waved the sock puppet at the final all-hands meeting: "Comrades, we have spiritually disrupted the sock industry!"

The NASDAQ dropped 80%.

**Many people's savings went to zero.**

## Why It Happened

### 1. The Story Was Too Good

"The internet changes everything!"

This story was true. The internet did change everything.

But a true story ≠ a profitable stock.

**Right story + Wrong price = Lost money**

### 2. No One Looked at Fundamentals

Pets.com had no profit. Barely any revenue.

But everyone was buying.

"Who cares about profit? This is the future!"

### 3. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)

"My neighbor made 100%!"

"If I don't buy, I'm losing money!"

When everyone is making money, not making money feels like losing money.

## The Lessons

### Lesson 1: Story ≠ Value

Next time you hear "this is the future," ask yourself:

- Is this company making money?
- If not, when will it?
- Is the current stock price reasonable?

### Lesson 2: Signs of a Bubble

When you see these, be cautious:

| Signal | 2000 Example | Timeless Form |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Drivers discussing stocks | ✓ | Uninformed people start investing |
| Unprofitable companies with soaring prices | ✓ | Valuations detached from reality |
| "This time is different" | ✓ | New paradigm narrative |
| Everyone is making money | ✓ | FOMO spreads |
| Worst companies rise fastest | ✓ | Speculation runs wild |

### Lesson 3: After the Bubble Bursts, Good Companies Survive

After the 2000 bubble burst:

- Pets.com → Bankrupt
- Amazon → Dropped 90%, then rose 100x
- Google → IPO'd in 2004, became a giant

**Bubbles kill garbage, but good companies survive.**

## How to Avoid

### Method 1: Don't Buy Companies Without Profit

Or at least, don't go heavy.

### Method 2: Ask the "Driver Question"

If taxi drivers, hairdressers, and relatives who don't understand stocks are all discussing a stock—

**Run.**

### Method 3: Buy the Index

Index funds contain both good and bad companies.

After a bubble bursts, bad companies get kicked out, good ones stay.

**You don't have to choose.**
