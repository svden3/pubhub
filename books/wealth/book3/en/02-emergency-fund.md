## The Story

In 2011, NeuralMind shut down.

My 0.05% equity became worthless.

Eleven years of my life, packed into one cardboard box.

But I didn't panic.

Because I had savings. Because my index funds were still growing.

Sarah said: "**See, that's the point of diversification. Your human capital went to zero, but your financial capital is still there.**"

## The Rules

### Rule 1: Build an emergency fund first

Before investing in anything, save **6 months of living expenses**.

This money:

- Is only used for true emergencies

### Rule 2: What counts as an emergency

✅ Job loss
✅ Medical emergency
✅ Unexpected major expense

❌ Stock market crash you want to "buy the dip"
❌ New car
❌ Vacation

### Rule 3: Save first, then invest

```

    ↓
Step 2: Save 6 months emergency fund
    ↓
Step 3: Start investing
```
