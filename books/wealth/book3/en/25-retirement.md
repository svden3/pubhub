## Sarah's Math Lesson

2020. Sarah was 48.

"I'm going to retire."

"Are you crazy? You're only 48."

"I did the math." She pulled out a piece of paper:

```
My math:

Google stock: Enough for 15 years
Index funds: Enough for 10 years
House: Paid off
Health insurance: ACA covered
Annual expenses: $80,000

Conclusion: I can live to 95.
```

"But... aren't you afraid of having nothing to do?"

"**I want to paint. I've waited 16 years for this day.**"

## The Three Numbers of Retirement

### Number One: How Much Do You Need?

**Simple formula**:
```
Retirement savings = Annual expenses × 25
```

This is the **4% rule** — withdrawing 4% annually from retirement savings theoretically lasts 30+ years.

**Examples**:
- $60,000/year expenses → Need $1,500,000
- $80,000/year expenses → Need $2,000,000
- $100,000/year expenses → Need $2,500,000

Mama said:
> "Son, this is just theory. In reality, you won't spend the same amount. Expenses at 60 and 80 are completely different."

---

### Number Two: How Much Time Do You Have?

**The magic of compound interest**:
```
Starting at 25 vs 35

Assume $500/month, 7% annual return:

Start at 25 → $1,200,000 at 65
Start at 35 → $567,000 at 65
```

**10 years difference = $630,000**

Sarah said:
> "Compound interest is a function of time. The earlier you start, the further you go."

---

### Number Three: How Many Income Sources?

**Ideal retirement income sources**:
```
1. Social Security          — Basic safety net
2. Retirement accounts (401k/IRA) — Tax-advantaged
3. Investment income (dividends/interest) — Passive income
4. Part-time/consulting     — If you want
```

**Mike's lesson**:
> "All my money was in Enron stock. Retirement, 401k, personal account.
> I thought I was a millionaire.
> Three months later, I had nothing."

**Rule**: Have at least 2-3 independent retirement income sources.

## Retirement Accounts: Silicon Valley's Tax Weapons

### 401(k): Your Company Helps You Save

```
2024 limit: $23,000 (50+ add $7,500)

Pros:
✓ Pre-tax contributions, save on taxes now
✓ Company match (free money!)
✓ Automatic deductions, no discipline needed

Cons:
✗ Penalty for withdrawal before 59.5
✗ Taxed as income on withdrawal
✗ Limited investment options
```

**Mama's order**:
> "Son, contribute at least up to the company match in your 401k. Not doing so is giving free money to the government."

---

### Roth IRA: Best Choice for Young People

```
2024 limit: $7,000 (50+ add $1,000)

Pros:
✓ After-tax contributions, tax-free growth
✓ Completely tax-free withdrawals
✓ Flexibility in retirement
✓ No required minimum distributions

Cons:
✗ Income limits ($161k single / $240k married)
✗ Lower contribution limits
```

**Sarah's advice**:
> "Young with low income, low tax rate. Use Roth IRA.
> Old with high income, high tax rate. Use Traditional 401k.
> This is tax arbitrage."

## The Four Phases of Retirement

### Phase 1: Accumulation (25-45)

**Goal**: Save as much as possible

```
Strategy:
- Max out 401k + Roth IRA
- Invest primarily in stocks
- Accept volatility, pursue growth
- Don't touch retirement accounts
```

---

### Phase 2: Transition (45-55)

**Goal**: Reduce risk, protect principal

```
Strategy:
- Gradually shift from stocks to bonds
- Start planning post-retirement life
- Calculate your "number"
- Consider early retirement possibility
```

Sarah at 45:
> "I started seriously calculating. Stocks went from 80% to 60%. Bonds went from 10% to 30%. Cash stayed at 10%."

---

### Phase 3: Early Retirement (55-70)

**Goal**: Active, free, with choices

```
Strategy:
- Health is the biggest investment
- Can do what you want
- Expenses may be higher than working years (travel, hobbies)
- Keep some stock allocation (fight inflation)
```

---

### Phase 4: Late Retirement (70+)

**Goal**: Simplify, peace of mind, legacy

```
Strategy:
- Expenses usually decrease
- Healthcare costs rise
- Consider estate planning
- Simplify portfolio
```

Mama said:
> "Son, at this age, money isn't the most important thing. What matters is having someone to eat dinner with."

## Early Retirement? The FIRE Movement

**FIRE = Financial Independence, Retire Early**

```
Core formula:
Savings rate determines retirement timeline

10% savings rate → Need to work 51 years
25% savings rate → Need to work 32 years
50% savings rate → Need to work 17 years
75% savings rate → Need to work 7 years
```

**Sarah's view**:
> "FIRE is great, but not for everyone.
> Some people need the meaning of work.
> Some people need the social aspect of colleagues.
> Financial freedom is just a tool, not the goal."

## The True Meaning of Retirement

2024. Two years after Sarah retired.

I asked her: "What's the biggest discovery after retirement?"

She said:

> "**Time is more precious than money.**
>
> I used to think retirement was about money.
> Now I know retirement is about time.
>
> Money can be earned again. Time cannot.
>
> I now paint four hours every day. A hundred times happier than meetings at Google."
