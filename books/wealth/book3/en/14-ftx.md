# Chapter 14: Effective Altruism or Effective Embezzlement

> **2022 FTX Bankruptcy**

---

## What Happened

Sam Bankman-Fried, 30 years old, worth $26 billion.

He founded FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange.

He said he believed in "effective altruism" — making money to donate to charity.

He wore T-shirts and shorts, lived in a "commune" in the Bahamas with nine roommates.

"We are simple idealists."

Investors lined up to give him money. Sequoia Capital, SoftBank, Tom Brady...

In November 2022, FTX went bankrupt.

**Customer funds... disappeared.**

Turns out he used customer deposits to invest, buy houses, pay himself.

"Effective altruism" became "effective embezzlement."

Tommy lost money too. He had put his last few thousand on FTX.

## Why It Happened

### 1. The Halo Was Too Bright

- 30 years old, $26 billion net worth
- Magazine covers
- Photos with celebrities
- Says he'll donate all his money to charity

**Who would suspect someone who says they'll give all their money away?**

### 2. No One Audited

The crypto industry has almost no regulation.

No one checked FTX's books.

By the time problems were discovered, the money was gone.

### 3. Investors Didn't Do Their Homework

Sequoia Capital invested in FTX without proper due diligence.

"He's so smart, we trust him."

**Smart ≠ Honest. Halo ≠ Ability.**

## The Lessons

### Lesson 1: Watch Actions, Not Slogans

| What He Said | What He Did |
|--------------|-------------|
| I'll donate all my money | Used customer funds to buy mansions |
| We are simple idealists | Lived in luxury Bahamas apartments |
| I believe in effective altruism | Effectively embezzled customer funds |

**When someone says they're making money to help others, first check how they spend their own money.**

### Lesson 2: Regulation Exists for a Reason

Traditional banks have:
- Deposit insurance (FDIC)
- Regular audits
- Capital requirements
- Regulatory oversight

Crypto exchanges don't have these.

**"Decentralization" sounds cool, but your money has no protection.**

### Lesson 3: Don't Put Money in Unregulated Places

If a platform:
- Is unregulated
- Can't prove where the money is
- Founder sounds too good to be true

**That's not an investment platform, that's a gambling platform.**

## Red Flags

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Founder says they'll donate everything | Might be moral manipulation |
| Company is unregulated | Your money has no protection |
| Returns are too good to be true | Might be a Ponzi scheme |
| Audit reports don't exist or are suspicious | Money might not be there |
| Founder dresses too casually | Might be deliberate image crafting |

## How to Avoid

### Method 1: Only Use Regulated Platforms

In the US:
- Banks: FDIC insurance
- Brokerages: SIPC insurance
- Crypto: Coinbase is publicly traded, has some protections

### Method 2: Don't Keep Large Amounts on Crypto Exchanges

OK for trading, but after buying, transfer to your own wallet.

"Not your keys, not your coins."

### Method 3: Be Suspicious of "Good People"

Scammers love pretending to be good people.

**Real good people don't need to constantly emphasize they're good people.**
