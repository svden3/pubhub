## The Question

"Public school or private school?"

This is every Silicon Valley parent's question.

The answer isn't "which is better," but "what suits you."

## The Numbers

### Cost Comparison (California 2025)

| Type | Annual Cost | K-12 Total |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Public | $0 | $0 |
| Private (average) | $25,000-40,000 | $325,000-520,000 |
| Private (elite) | $50,000-65,000 | $650,000-845,000 |

**Private K-12 can cost more than college.**

### Opportunity Cost

If you invested $50,000/year in index funds instead, after 18 years:

```
$50,000/year
× 18 years
× 7% annual return
= ~$1,700,000
```

**One point seven million dollars.**

This is the real cost of choosing private school.

## Hidden Options

### Option 1: Buy into a Good School District

Buying a house in a good district might be more cost-effective than private school:

```
Cupertino vs Los Gatos house price difference: ~$500,000
But this is an asset, not an expense
18 years later the house may appreciate
```

**Houses appreciate, tuition doesn't come back.**

### Option 2: Public + Supplements

Public school + extracurriculars:

```
Public school: $0
Piano lessons: $5,000/year
Coding classes: $3,000/year
Summer camp: $5,000/year
Tutoring: $5,000/year
---
Total: ~$18,000/year
```

**Half the cost of private, more flexibility.**

### Option 3: Private High School Only

Some families' strategy:

- K-8: Public
- 9-12: Private

4 years private high school: $200,000 vs K-12 private: $700,000

**Saves $500,000.**

## The Real Questions

Ask yourself:

1. **Why do you want your child in private school?**
   - If it's "everyone does it," that's not a good reason
   - If it's "child has special needs," worth considering

2. **Will this affect your financial security?**
   - If you need to borrow or tap retirement → Not worth it
   - If you can afford it comfortably → Consider it

3. **Does your child really need it?**
   - Some kids succeed in any environment
   - Some kids need a specific environment

## Mama's Perspective

Mama went to public school in Baton Rouge.

She said: "**School teaches knowledge, family teaches character. A good school is a bonus, not a necessity.**"

Sarah graduated from Berkeley, a public university.

She said: "**The most successful people I know didn't come from the best schools. They're the ones who worked hardest.**"
