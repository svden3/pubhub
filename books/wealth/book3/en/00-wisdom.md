# Prologue: Three Mentors

> "Ancient and modern, East and West — wisdom is universal."

## Jim's Three Mentors

For 25 years, three "mentors" have guided me.

They never met. They lived 2,500 years apart.

But they were all saying the same thing.

---

## Mentor One: Sun Tzu

**500 BC, Kingdom of Wu, China**

Sun Wu wrote *The Art of War*.

He wasn't teaching how to fight — he was teaching how to **win without fighting**.

> "The skillful warrior first makes himself invincible, then waits for the enemy's moment of vulnerability."
>
> — *The Art of War*, Chapter 4

**Translation**: First ensure you can't lose, then wait for the chance to win.

This is the first principle of investing: **Don't lose first**.

---

### Sun Tzu's Investment Wisdom

| Sun Tzu | Investment Translation |
|---------|----------------------|
| "Know the enemy and know yourself, in a hundred battles you will never be in peril" | Understand the market, understand yourself |
| "The general who wins makes many calculations before the battle" | Do your homework before investing |
| "In war, the way is to avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak" | Buy value, not hype |
| "Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight" | Crisis creates opportunity |
| "The skillful warrior puts himself beyond the possibility of defeat" | Margin of safety first |

---

## Mentor Two: Benjamin Graham

**1949, New York**

Benjamin Graham wrote *The Intelligent Investor*.

Warren Buffett calls him "the greatest investment teacher of all time."

> "The secret to investing is: buy when the price is far below intrinsic value, with a sufficient margin of safety."
>
> — Benjamin Graham

**Translation**: Buy cheap, don't buy expensive.

This is the second principle of investing: **Margin of Safety**.

---

### Graham's Investment Wisdom

| Graham Principle | Simple Translation |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Margin of Safety | Leave room for error, buy bargains |
| Mr. Market | The market is emotional, don't let it control you |
| Intrinsic Value | Focus on real value, not price |
| Diversification | Spread your bets, don't put all eggs in one basket |
| Long-term | Hold long, let compound interest work |

---

## Mentor Three: King Solomon

**950 BC, Jerusalem**

King Solomon was the wealthiest king of Israel.

He wrote Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.

> "Guard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life."
>
> — Proverbs 4:23

**Translation**: Managing your mindset matters more than managing your money.

This is the third principle of investing: **Discipline and Mindset**.

---

### Biblical Investment Wisdom

| Scripture | Investment Translation |
|-----------|----------------------|
| "The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty" (Proverbs 21:5) | Plan carefully, don't be impulsive |
| "The crown of the wise is their wealth" (Proverbs 14:24) | Wisdom matters more than money |
| "He who loves money will not be satisfied with money" (Ecclesiastes 5:10) | Contentment beats greed |
| "Commit your work to the Lord" (Proverbs 16:3) | Do your best, accept the outcome |
| "What does the wise man have over the fool?" (Ecclesiastes 2:16) | Stay humble, markets are unpredictable |
| "Divide your portion to seven, or even to eight" (Ecclesiastes 11:2) | Diversify |

---

## What All Three Agree On

| Theme | Sun Tzu | Graham | Bible |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| **Defense First** | Make yourself invincible first | Margin of Safety | The wise are cautious |
| **Know Yourself** | Know the enemy and yourself | Understand what you invest in | Guard your heart |
| **Don't Be Greedy** | Victory is the objective, not prolonged warfare | Don't chase the market | Those who love money are never satisfied |
| **Diversify Risk** | Use regular troops to engage, extraordinary to win | Diversification | Divide to seven or eight |
| **Long-term Thinking** | Many calculations lead to victory | Compound interest needs time | Diligent planning leads to abundance |
| **Stay Humble** | Know that you don't know | Mr. Market is unpredictable | What does the wise have over the fool? |

## Mama's Summary

Mama never read *The Art of War*.

Mama never read *The Intelligent Investor*.

Mama doesn't read the Bible often.

But what she says is exactly the same as these three mentors:

> "**First think about how not to lose, then think about how to win.**" (Sun Tzu)
>
> "**Buy when it's cheap, don't touch it when it's expensive.**" (Graham)
>
> "**Managing your heart matters more than managing your money.**" (Solomon)

Wisdom is universal.
