# Chapter 7: Holding Is the Hardest Part

> "Sarah said: The hardest part of investing isn't buying. It's holding."

## The Story

March 2009. The market hit bottom.

My $100,000 in index funds had shrunk to $55,000.

I called Sarah.

"Should I sell?"

"Are you crazy? **Now is the time to buy more.**"

"But I've already lost 45%."

"That's just a paper loss. Look at those companies — Apple, Google, Microsoft — did their businesses disappear?"

"No."

"Then don't sell."

I didn't sell.

In 2024, that investment had grown more than 4x.

**If I had sold then, I would have locked in a 45% loss forever.**

## The Rules

### Rule 1: Distinguish Paper Loss from Real Loss

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Paper loss | Account shows red, but you haven't sold |
| Real loss | You sold, money is actually gone |

**As long as you don't sell, it's just numbers fluctuating.**

### Rule 2: Watch the Company, Not the Stock Price

When the stock price drops, ask yourself:

- Is the company still making money?
- Are people still buying the products?
- Does it still have long-term competitive advantage?

If the answer is "yes" — **it's just market sentiment, not a real problem.**

### Rule 3: Time Is Your Friend

| Holding Period | Probability of Loss (US Stocks) |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 day | ~45% |
| 1 year | ~30% |
| 10 years | ~5% |
| 20 years | ~0% |

**The longer you hold, the lower the chance of losing money.**

## What Will Happen While You Hold

During your 20 years of holding, you will experience:

- 3-5 drops of 20% or more
- 1-2 crashes of 40% or more
- Countless "this time is different" panics
- Countless urges to sell

**This is all normal.**

The S&P 500 has hit new highs after every crash in history. Every time.

## How to Do It

### Method 1: Don't Check Your Account

Set a rule: Only check your account once a month.

Or harder: Only once a year.

**The less you look, the fewer chances to make mistakes.**

### Method 2: Write Down Your Reasons

When you buy, write:

> "I'm buying VOO because I believe the US economy will grow long-term.
> I plan to hold for 20 years.
> I won't sell even if it drops 50%."

When it drops, pull it out and read it.

### Method 3: Automate

Set up automatic investing, then:
- Delete stock apps
- Unsubscribe from financial news
- Don't discuss stocks with friends

**Boredom is the right feeling.**

## One Line

> **Buying is the apprentice's skill. Holding is the master's art.**

## Three Mentors Say

| Mentor | Wisdom |
|--------|--------|
| **Sun Tzu** | "The skilled warrior first makes himself invincible, then waits for the enemy's moment of vulnerability" — First ensure you can't lose, then wait for the chance to win |
| **Graham** | "The investor's chief problem — and even his worst enemy — is likely to be himself" — Impulsive selling is the biggest mistake |
| **Bible** | "The one who endures to the end will be saved" (Matthew 24:13) — Only those who persist to the end will see results |
