# Chapter 21: Financial Literacy Starts Young

> "Mama said: Give a child a fish, you feed them for a day. Give a child money, you spoil them. Teach a child to manage money, you prepare them for life."

## The Problem

Tommy, Mike's son.

He used his college tuition to buy GameStop.
He put his remaining money on FTX.
He asked his dad to lend him money to buy Nvidia.

Why?

**Because no one taught him how to manage money.**

Schools don't teach it. Parents assume he'll "figure it out when he grows up."

Result: Generation after generation stepping into the same traps.

## When to Start

| Age | Concepts You Can Teach |
|-----|------------------------|
| 3-5 years | What money is, value of different coins |
| 6-8 years | Saving vs spending, wants vs needs |
| 9-12 years | Budgeting, compound interest, goal saving |
| 13-15 years | Earning money, bank accounts, debit cards |
| 16-18 years | Investing basics, credit, taxes |

**The earlier you start, the easier habits form.**

## Practical Methods

### 1. Give Allowance, But With Rules

Starting at age 6, give a fixed weekly allowance.

Rules:
- **Save 30%** — Long-term savings
- **Give 10%** — Charity
- **Spend 60%** — Free to use

**Let them experience the cost of choices.**

### 2. Three Jars

Buy three clear jars:

| Jar | Purpose | Rule |
|-----|---------|------|
| 🏦 Save | Long-term goals | Don't touch easily |
| 🎁 Spend | Daily wants | Free to use |
| ❤️ Give | Helping others | Donate regularly |

**Visual helps children understand where money goes.**

### 3. Let Them Make Mistakes

Kid wants to use allowance to buy a junk toy?

**Let them buy it.**

Three days later when it breaks, they learn a lesson.

**A $10 lesson is cheaper than a $10,000 lesson.**

### 4. Open Up Your Finances

Many families treat money as taboo.

But children need to see real numbers:

- Family income
- Mortgage payment
- Monthly savings
- What investment accounts look like

**Not bragging, but educating.**

### 5. Invest Together

Open a custodial account for your child.

Let them pick a stock or ETF.

- Review financial reports together (simplified)
- Discuss what the company does
- Experience the ups and downs together

**Experience is the best teacher.**

## Key Conversations

### Conversation 1: Wants vs Needs

Child: "I want this toy!"

You: "Is this a 'want' or a 'need'?"

Child: "A want."

You: "OK, are you willing to use your allowance to buy it?"

### Conversation 2: Compound Interest

Explain compound interest with $100:

"If you save $100 and it grows 10% per year:
- After 1 year: $110
- After 10 years: $259
- After 30 years: $1,745

**Your money makes money for you. That's why saving early matters.**"

### Conversation 3: Risk

"Uncle Tommy bought GameStop, made money, then lost it all. Why?"

"Because that was gambling, not investing. **Investing is buying good companies and holding long-term. Gambling is guessing if it goes up or down tomorrow.**"
