# Chapter 27: Silicon Valley Chinese Churches

> **Mom said: "Son, in a foreign land, church is home."**

## My First Sunday

January 2000, I had just arrived in Silicon Valley.

No friends, knew no one, living in a small apartment in Sunnyvale.

Sunday morning, I saw a group of Chinese people walking into a building in a Cupertino shopping center parking lot.

The sign read: **River of Life Christian Church**.

I followed them in.

That became my first "home" in Silicon Valley.

## Why Silicon Valley Chinese Love Church

### Reason 1: Community

**Sarah's observation:**

> "When I first came to Silicon Valley, I knew no one.
> Church was the only place to make friends.
>
> Small group Bible study, Sunday potlucks, choir practice...
> At least three meetings per week.
>
> **These people became godparents to my children.**"

### Reason 2: Children

**Chinese parents' thinking:**

```
At church, children can:

1. Learn Chinese (Sunday school, summer camp)
2. Make Chinese friends (not just white kids from school)
3. Learn morals (Ten Commandments, love thy neighbor)
4. Stay away from drugs and bad influences (church is "safe")
```

Mike said:

> "I'm not very religious, but I take my kids every week.
> I'd rather they spend Sunday at church
> than at home playing video games."

### Reason 3: Meaning

**The 40-year-old crisis:**

Typical Silicon Valley engineer trajectory:

```
25: Get H1B, work hard
30: Get green card, buy house
35: Promote to Staff/Principal, stock grows
40: Then what?

House done, car done, kids done, 401k done...
Then what?
```

Many start going to church at 40 because they're asking this question.

## Church Economics

### Tithing

**Traditional teaching:**

```
Give 10% of income to church

Annual income $200,000 × 10% = $20,000/year

More than any other charitable donation.
```

**Sarah's approach:**

> "I give 5% to church, 5% to other charities.
> Together that's 10%.
>
> Church uses this money for many things:
> - Pastor's salary
> - Rent for facilities
> - Children's ministry
> - Community service
>
> **I know where the money goes. That matters.**"

### Tax Benefits

```
Donations are tax-deductible (Itemized Deduction)

Assume:
- Annual income $300,000
- Donation $30,000
- Tax rate 35%

Actual cost: $30,000 × (1-35%) = $19,500

Government paid $10,500 of it.
```

## Life Stages at Church

### Age 20-30: Singles Fellowship

```
First stop in Silicon Valley:

- Find a spouse (small Chinese circle, church is biggest dating pool)
- Make friends (sports, outings, Bible study together)
- Learn English (many churches have ESL)
- Find jobs (referrals, career sharing)

**Many Silicon Valley Chinese couples met at church.**
```

### Age 30-40: Family Fellowship

```
After marriage and kids:

- Bring children to Sunday school
- Hang out with other families with kids
- Discuss education, schools, housing
- Help each other (carpools, moving)

**Church is the biggest "mom group."**
```

### Age 40-50: Adults Fellowship

```
After career stabilizes:

- Start serving (small group leader, deacon)
- Think about life's meaning
- Help newcomers
- Community service

**From "consumer" to "contributor."**
```

### Age 50+: Senior Fellowship

```
After kids leave home:

- More time for church
- Short-term missions, training, mentoring
- Pass experience to next generation
- Prepare for retirement

**Church is the best post-retirement community.**
```

## The Dark Side of Church

### Problem 1: Gossip

**Sarah's complaint:**

> "Church is a small circle.
> Who got divorced, whose kid didn't get into a good college,
> the whole church knows within two days.
>
> **Sometimes it's more political than work.**"

### Problem 2: Comparison

```
Unspoken rules in Chinese church:

- Who works at which company
- Whose kid goes to which school
- Whose house is in which neighborhood

Nobody says it out loud, but everyone's comparing.
```

### Problem 3: Pastor Worship

```
Some churches:

- Pastor has final say on everything
- Finances not transparent
- Questioning seen as "disobedience"

**Mom said: "Church is made of people. Where there are people, there are problems."**
```

### Problem 4: Second Generation Leaving

```
The Chinese church dilemma:

Parents' generation: Speak Chinese, traditional values
Kids' generation: Speak English, American culture

Many ABCs stop coming in high school/college.
Hard to keep young people in English service.
```

## How to Choose a Church

### Principle 1: Sound Doctrine

```
Core beliefs must be right:

□ Bible is God's word
□ Jesus is the only Savior
□ Belief in the Trinity
□ Not a cult (Mormon, Jehovah's Witness, Eastern Lightning)
```

### Principle 2: Fit Your Life Stage

```
Single? → Find one with active singles fellowship
Have kids? → Find one with strong children's ministry
English-dominant? → Find one with good English service
New to US? → Find one with ESL and newcomer care
```

### Principle 3: Reasonable Distance

```
Don't choose a church too far away.

Too far = Low participation = Weak community

Best within 15-20 minute drive.
```

### Principle 4: Try Several

```
Don't commit to the first one you visit.

Visit several churches, attend small groups,
feel out the culture and atmosphere.

**Finding "home" takes time.**
```

## Mom's Story

Mom has been at her church in Baton Rouge for 30 years.

She's not any kind of leader—she just cooks every week.

For Sunday potluck, she's always first to arrive, last to leave.

Her Gumbo has fed three generations.

Last year for her 80th birthday, the church threw her a party.

Over 200 people came.

The pastor said: **"This lady served our entire community with a pot of soup."**

Mom said:

> "Son, church isn't the building—it's the people.
> I can't preach, I can't lead worship,
> but I can cook.
>
> **Everyone has their own way to serve.**"

## One-Liner

> **Church is not where perfect people gather; it's where imperfect people journey toward perfection together.**
