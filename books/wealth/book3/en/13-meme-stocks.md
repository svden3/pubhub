# Chapter 13: Memes Are Not Investments

> **2021 GameStop and Crypto Frenzy**

---

## What Happened

### GameStop (GME)

In 2021, retail traders on Reddit decided to unite.

Target: Make Wall Street short sellers on GameStop go bankrupt.

Slogan: **"To the moon! 🚀"**

GameStop went from $20 to $483. In one week.

Mike's son Tommy put his college tuition into GME.

He made money. Then lost it. Then made it again. Then lost it all.

"At least," Tommy said, "we sent a message."

"What message?"

"Uh... the power of retail investors?"

### Cryptocurrency

That same year, Elon Musk tweeted a picture of a dog.

Dogecoin went from $0.01 to $0.70.

Tommy said: "Uncle Jim, you have to buy Dogecoin."

"Why?"

"Because Elon Musk tweeted a dog!"

I didn't buy.

Dogecoin is now $0.08.

## Why It Happened

### 1. Pandemic Boredom

In 2020-2021, everyone was stuck at home.

Nothing to do, so they traded stocks.

### 2. Free Trading

Robinhood made trading a game.

No fees. One click to buy.

**Too easy, so too casual.**

### 3. Social Media

Reddit, Twitter, TikTok...

"Someone on r/wallstreetbets said to buy this!"

**Investment decisions became herd behavior.**

### 4. FOMO + Emojis

🚀 💎 🙌

**When investments are expressed in emojis, that's not investing.**

## The Lessons

### Lesson 1: Movement ≠ Investment

GME retail traders wanted to "beat Wall Street."

That's a social movement, not an investment strategy.

**The movement might be right, but your money might be wrong.**

### Lesson 2: Emojis Are Not Analysis

"🚀 To the moon" is not an investment thesis.

"💎🙌 Diamond hands" is not a holding strategy.

**Real investing needs numbers, not emojis.**

### Lesson 3: Short-Term Trading Is Gambling

| Investing | Gambling |
|-----------|----------|
| Based on value | Based on luck |
| Long-term holding | Short-term swings |
| Analytical decisions | Emotional decisions |
| Most people can win | Most people lose |

GME, Dogecoin — this kind of short-term speculation, most people lose money.

Sarah said: "**Anything priced by emojis is not an investment, it's a gamble.**"

She also said: "**He chases heat, not value. Always chasing, always bag-holding.**"

## How to Avoid

### Method 1: Don't Use Reddit/Twitter for Investment Decisions

Social media is entertainment, not investment advice.

### Method 2: Ask Yourself "Is This Investing or Gambling"

| Question | If yes, probably gambling |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Did I buy because of emojis? | ✓ |
| Do I expect to double in a week? | ✓ |
| Do I not know what this company does? | ✓ |
| Did I buy because others were buying? | ✓ |

### Method 3: Set Up a "Gambling Account"

If you really want to play, take 5% of your portfolio as a "gambling account."

If you lose it all, it won't affect your life.

**But the other 95%, use for serious investing.**

## One Line

## Checklist

- [ ] I don't buy stocks based on social media hype
- [ ] I don't expect to double in a week
- [ ] I can distinguish investing from gambling
