# 五旬節 (Pentecost)

使徒行傳 Acts 1-2

## 經文 (Scripture)

### 一、升天與應許 (The Ascension and Promise)

使徒行傳 1:1-11

#### 中文 — 和合本修訂版 (RCUV)

> ^1^提阿非羅啊，我已經作了前書，論到耶穌開頭一切所行所教導的，^2^直到他藉着聖靈吩咐所揀選的使徒後被接上升的日子。^3^他受害以後，用許多確據向使徒顯明自己是活着的，四十天之久向他們顯現，講論神國的事。

> ^4^耶穌和他們聚集的時候，囑咐他們說：<red>「不要離開耶路撒冷，要等候父的應許，就是你們聽我說過的。^5^約翰是用水施洗，但不多幾日，你們要受聖靈的洗。」</red>

> ^6^他們聚集的時候，問耶穌說：「主啊，你復興以色列國就在這時候嗎？」^7^耶穌對他們說：<red>「父憑着自己的權柄所定的時候或日期，不是你們可以知道的。^8^但聖靈降臨在你們身上，你們就必得着能力，並要在耶路撒冷、猶太全地和撒瑪利亞，直到地極，作我的見證。」</red>

> ^9^說了這些話，他們正看的時候，他被取上升，有一朵雲彩把他接去，便看不見他了。^10^他往上升的時候，他們定睛望天，忽然有兩個穿白衣的人站在他們旁邊，^11^說：「加利利人哪，你們為甚麼站着望天呢？這離開你們被接升天的耶穌，你們見他怎樣往天上去，他還要怎樣來。」

#### English — NKJV

> ^1^The former account I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, ^2^until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen, ^3^to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.

> ^4^And being assembled together with them, He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, "which," He said, <red>"you have heard from Me; ^5^for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."</red>

> ^6^Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, "Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" ^7^And He said to them, <red>"It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority. ^8^But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth."</red>

> ^9^Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. ^10^And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, ^11^who also said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven."

### 二、五旬節聖靈降臨 (The Coming of the Holy Spirit)

使徒行傳 2:1-13

#### 中文 — 和合本修訂版 (RCUV)

> ^1^五旬節那日到了，門徒都聚集在一處。^2^忽然，從天上有響聲下來，好像一陣大風吹過，充滿了他們所坐的整座屋子；^3^又有舌頭如火焰向他們顯現，分開落在他們每個人身上。^4^他們都被聖靈充滿，就按着聖靈所賜的口才說起別國的話來。

> ^5^那時，有從天下各國來的虔誠的猶太人，住在耶路撒冷。^6^這聲音一響，眾人都來聚集，各人聽見門徒用他們各人的鄉談說話，就甚納悶，^7^都詫異驚奇說：「看哪，這些說話的不都是加利利人嗎？^8^我們各人怎麼聽見他們說我們生來所用的鄉談呢？」

> ^12^眾人都驚訝困惑，彼此說：「這是甚麼意思呢？」^13^還有人譏諷說：「他們是灌滿了新酒吧！」

#### English — NKJV

> ^1^When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. ^2^And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. ^3^Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them. ^4^And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

> ^5^And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. ^6^And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language. ^7^Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, "Look, are not all these who speak Galileans? ^8^And how is it that we hear, each in our own language in which we were born?"

> ^12^So they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, "Whatever could this mean?" ^13^Others mocking said, "They are full of new wine."

### 三、彼得的講道 (Peter's Sermon)

使徒行傳 2:14-41

#### 中文 — 和合本修訂版 (RCUV)

> ^14^彼得和十一個使徒站起來，他就高聲向眾人說：「猶太人和所有住在耶路撒冷的人哪，這件事你們要知道，要側耳聽我的話。^15^這些人並非像你們所想的喝醉了，因為現在才早晨九點鐘。^16^這正是藉先知約珥所說的：

> ^17^『神說：在末後的日子，我要將我的靈澆灌凡有血肉的。你們的兒女要說預言，你們的年輕人要見異象，你們的老年人要做異夢。^18^在那些日子，我要將我的靈澆灌我的僕人和婢女，他們就要說預言。』

> ^22^「以色列人哪，你們要聽我這些話：拿撒勒人耶穌就是神用異能、奇事、神蹟向你們證明出來的人，這些事是神藉着耶穌在你們中間施行的，正如你們自己知道的。^23^他既按着神確定的旨意和預知被交給你們，你們就藉着不法之人的手把他釘在十字架上，殺了。^24^神卻將死的痛苦解除，使他復活了，因為他原不能被死拘禁。」

> ^36^「所以，以色列全家應當確確實實地知道，你們釘在十字架上的這位耶穌，神已經立他為主、為基督了。」

> ^37^眾人聽見這話，覺得扎心，就對彼得和其餘的使徒說：「弟兄們，我們該怎樣做？」^38^彼得對他們說：「你們各人要悔改，奉耶穌基督的名受洗，使你們的罪得赦免，就會領受所賜的聖靈。^39^因為這應許是給你們和你們的兒女，並一切在遠方的人，就是給所有主——我們神所召來的人。」

> ^41^於是，領受他話的人都受了洗。那一天，門徒約添了三千人。

#### English — NKJV

> ^14^But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said to them, "Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and heed my words. ^15^For these are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. ^16^But this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:

> ^17^'And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, Your young men shall see visions, Your old men shall dream dreams. ^18^And on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days; And they shall prophesy.'

> ^22^"Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man attested by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know— ^23^Him, being delivered by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by lawless hands, have crucified, and put to death; ^24^whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be held by it."

> ^36^"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ."

> ^37^Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" ^38^Then Peter said to them, "Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. ^39^For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call."

> ^41^Then those who gladly received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls were added to them.

## 神學要點 (Theological Points)

### 1. 聖靈的工作

- **能力 (δύναμις)** — 為基督作見證的能力
- **充滿** — 不是一次性，而是持續的經歷
- **方言** — 為了傳福音給萬國

### 2. 教會的誕生

五旬節標誌著：
- 新約教會的開始
- 聖靈內住信徒的時代
- 福音向萬國擴展的開始

### 3. 彼得講道的核心

- 耶穌是彌賽亞
- 祂被釘十架是神的計劃
- 祂從死裡復活
- 祂被高舉為主、為基督

## 個人反思 (Personal Reflection)

1. **你被聖靈充滿嗎？** 聖靈的能力不是為了個人榮耀，而是為了作見證。

2. **你是否順從聖靈的引導？** 聖靈要引導我們進入一切真理。

3. **你在哪裡作見證？** 從耶路撒冷（你的家）開始，直到地極。

## 配詩 (Hymns)

**聖詩**：*Spirit of God, Descend Upon My Heart*

> Spirit of God, descend upon my heart;
> Wean it from earth, through all its pulses move;
> Stoop to my weakness, mighty as Thou art,
> And make me love Thee as I ought to love.
