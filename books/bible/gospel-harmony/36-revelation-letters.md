# 給七教會的信 (Letters to the Seven Churches)

啟示錄 Revelation 1-3

## 經文 (Scripture)

### 一、榮耀基督的異象 (The Vision of the Glorified Christ)

啟示錄 1:9-18

#### 中文 — 和合本修訂版 (RCUV)

> ^9^我約翰，你們的弟兄，和你們在耶穌裏一同在患難、國度、忍耐中有份的，為神的道和為耶穌作的見證，曾在那名叫拔摩的海島上。^10^在主日，我被聖靈感動，聽見在我後面有大聲音如吹號，^11^說：<red>「你所看見的要寫在書上，寄給以弗所、士每拿、別迦摩、推雅推喇、撒狄、非拉鐵非、老底嘉七個教會。」</red>

> ^12^我轉過身來，要看看是誰的聲音在跟我說話；既轉過來，就看見七個金燈臺。^13^在燈臺中間有一位好像人子，身穿長衣，直垂到腳，胸間束著金帶。^14^他的頭與髮皆白，如白羊毛、如雪，眼目如同火焰，^15^腳好像在爐中鍛鍊發亮的銅，聲音如同眾水的聲音。^16^他右手拿著七顆星，從他口中出來一把兩刃的利劍，面貌如同烈日放光。

> ^17^我一看見，就仆倒在他腳前，像死了一樣。他用右手按著我，說：<red>「不要懼怕！我是首先的，我是末後的，^18^又是那活著的。我曾死過，看哪，現在又活了，直活到永永遠遠，並且拿著死亡和陰間的鑰匙。」</red>

#### English — NKJV

> ^9^I, John, both your brother and companion in the tribulation and kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was on the island that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. ^10^I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet, ^11^saying, <red>"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last,"</red> and, <red>"What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia."</red>

> ^12^Then I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands, ^13^and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band. ^14^His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire; ^15^His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters; ^16^He had in His right hand seven stars, out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and His countenance was like the sun shining in its strength.

> ^17^And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, <red>"Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last. ^18^I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death."</red>

### 二、給以弗所教會的信 (Letter to Ephesus)

啟示錄 2:1-7

#### 中文 — 和合本修訂版 (RCUV)

> ^1^<red>「你要寫信給以弗所教會的使者，說：『那右手拿著七顆星、在七個金燈臺中間行走的說：^2^我知道你的行為、勞碌、忍耐，也知道你不能容忍惡人。你曾試驗那自稱為使徒卻不是使徒的，看出他們是假的來。^3^你也能忍耐，曾為我的名勞苦，並不乏倦。</red>

> <red>^4^然而，我有一件事要責備你，就是你把起初的愛心離棄了。^5^所以，要回想你是從哪裏墜落的，並要悔改，做起初所做的事。你若不悔改，我就要臨到你那裏，把你的燈臺從原處移去。^6^然而你還有一件可取的事，就是你恨惡尼哥拉黨的行為，這也是我所恨惡的。^7^聖靈向眾教會所說的話，凡有耳的，就應當聽！得勝的，我必將神樂園中生命樹的果子賜給他吃。』」</red>

#### English — NKJV

> ^1^<red>"To the angel of the church of Ephesus write, 'These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands: ^2^I know your works, your labor, your patience, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. And you have tested those who say they are apostles and are not, and have found them liars; ^3^and you have persevered and have patience, and have labored for My name's sake and have not become weary.</red>

> <red>^4^Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love. ^5^Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent and do the first works, or else I will come to you quickly and remove your lampstand from its place—unless you repent. ^6^But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. ^7^He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.'"</red>

### 三、給士每拿教會的信 (Letter to Smyrna)

啟示錄 2:8-11

#### 中文 — 和合本修訂版 (RCUV)

> ^8^<red>「你要寫信給士每拿教會的使者，說：『那首先的、末後的、死過又活的說：^9^我知道你的患難、貧窮——其實你是富足的，也知道那自稱是猶太人所說的毀謗話，其實他們不是猶太人，而是撒但的會眾。^10^你將要受的苦你不用怕。魔鬼要把你們中間幾個人下在監裏，叫你們受考驗，你們必受患難十日。你務要至死忠心，我就賜給你那生命的冠冕。^11^聖靈向眾教會所說的話，凡有耳的，就應當聽！得勝的，必不受第二次死的害。』」</red>

#### English — NKJV

> ^8^<red>"And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write, 'These things says the First and the Last, who was dead, and came to life: ^9^I know your works, tribulation, and poverty (but you are rich); and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. ^10^Do not fear any of those things which you are about to suffer. Indeed, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life. ^11^He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death.'"</red>

### 四、給非拉鐵非教會的信 (Letter to Philadelphia)

啟示錄 3:7-13

#### 中文 — 和合本修訂版 (RCUV)

> ^7^<red>「你要寫信給非拉鐵非教會的使者，說：『那聖潔、真實、拿著大衛的鑰匙、開了就沒有人能關、關了就沒有人能開的說：^8^我知道你的行為。看哪，我在你面前給你一個敞開的門，是沒有人能關的。因為你稍微有一點力量，也遵守我的道，沒有否認我的名。</red>

> <red>^10^你既遵守我忍耐的道，我必在普天下人受試煉的時候，保守你免去你的試煉。^11^我必快來，你要持守你所有的，免得有人奪去你的冠冕。^12^得勝的，我要叫他在我神殿中作柱子，他也不再從那裏出去。我又要將我神的名和我神城的名——這城就是從天上、從我神那裏降下來的新耶路撒冷——並我的新名，都寫在他上面。^13^聖靈向眾教會所說的話，凡有耳的，就應當聽！』」</red>

#### English — NKJV

> ^7^<red>"And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, 'These things says He who is holy, He who is true, He who has the key of David, He who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens: ^8^I know your works. See, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it; for you have a little strength, have kept My word, and have not denied My name.</red>

> <red>^10^Because you have kept My command to persevere, I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth. ^11^Behold, I am coming quickly! Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown. ^12^He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go out no more. I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God. And I will write on him My new name. ^13^He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'"</red>

### 五、給老底嘉教會的信 (Letter to Laodicea)

啟示錄 3:14-22

#### 中文 — 和合本修訂版 (RCUV)

> ^14^<red>「你要寫信給老底嘉教會的使者，說：『那為阿們的，為誠信真實見證的，在神創造萬物之上為元首的說：^15^我知道你的行為，你也不冷也不熱；我巴不得你或冷或熱。^16^你既如溫水，也不冷也不熱，所以我要從我口中把你吐出去。</red>

> <red>^17^你說「我是富足的，已經發了財，一樣都不缺」，卻不知道你是困苦、可憐、貧窮、瞎眼、赤身的。^18^我勸你向我買火煉的金子，使你富足；又買白衣穿上，使你赤身的羞恥不露出來；又買眼藥擦你的眼睛，使你能看見。^19^凡我所愛的，我就責備管教；所以你要發熱心，也要悔改。</red>

> <red>^20^看哪，我站在門外叩門，若有聽見我聲音而開門的，我要進到他那裏去，我與他，他與我，一起吃飯。^21^得勝的，我要賜他在我寶座上與我同坐，就如我得了勝，在我父的寶座上與他同坐一般。^22^聖靈向眾教會所說的話，凡有耳的，就應當聽！』」</red>

#### English — NKJV

> ^14^<red>"And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, 'These things says the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God: ^15^I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I could wish you were cold or hot. ^16^So then, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth.</red>

> <red>^17^Because you say, "I am rich, have become wealthy, and have need of nothing"—and do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked— ^18^I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see. ^19^As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent.</red>

> <red>^20^Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me. ^21^To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne. ^22^He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'"</red>

| 教會 | 位置 | 基督的自稱 | 評價 | 應許 |
|------|------|-----------|------|------|
| 以弗所 | 亞細亞首府 | 拿著七星 | 離棄起初的愛 | 生命樹果子 |
| 士每拿 | 富裕港口 | 首先末後 | 貧窮卻富足 | 生命冠冕 |
| 別迦摩 | 撒但座位 | 兩刃利劍 | 容忍假教導 | 隱藏嗎哪 |
| 推雅推喇 | 商業中心 | 火焰眼目 | 容忍耶洗別 | 晨星 |
| 撒狄 | 死城 | 七靈七星 | 名活實死 | 白衣 |
| 非拉鐵非 | 弟兄之愛 | 大衛鑰匙 | 遵守主道 | 作殿中柱 |
| 老底嘉 | 銀行中心 | 阿們 | 不冷不熱 | 同坐寶座 |

### 基督的七重身份

從這些書信中，我們看到榮耀基督的全面啟示：

| 身份 | 意義 |
|------|------|
| 首先的、末後的 | 永恆的主 |
| 死過又活的 | 復活的主 |
| 拿著七星的 | 教會的主 |
| 口出利劍的 | 審判的主 |
| 大衛鑰匙的 | 掌權的主 |
| 阿們的 | 誠實的主 |
| 創造元首 | 萬有的主 |

---

## 神學要點 (Theological Points)

### 1. 復活基督的榮耀

約翰在福音書中曾靠在耶穌胸膛上，但在這裏看見榮耀的基督，就「仆倒在他腳前，像死了一樣」。

| 福音書中的耶穌 | 啟示錄中的基督 |
|--------------|--------------|
| 道成肉身 | 榮耀升天 |
| 溫柔謙卑 | 威嚴可畏 |
| 服事人 | 審判人 |
| 被釘十架 | 得勝坐寶座 |

### 2. 基督對教會的認識

「我知道」(Οἶδα) — 基督對每個教會的認識是完全的：
- 知道他們的行為
- 知道他們的患難
- 知道他們的軟弱
- 知道他們的假冒

### 3. 悔改的呼召

七封信中有五封呼召悔改。基督的警告出於愛：
> 「凡我所愛的，我就責備管教」(啟3:19)

### 4. 得勝者的應許

| 教會 | 應許 |
|------|------|
| 以弗所 | 吃生命樹果子 |
| 士每拿 | 不受第二次死 |
| 別迦摩 | 隱藏的嗎哪、白石新名 |
| 推雅推喇 | 制伏列國的權柄、晨星 |
| 撒狄 | 穿白衣、名不塗抹 |
| 非拉鐵非 | 作殿中柱、得新名 |
| 老底嘉 | 與基督同坐寶座 |

## 個人反思 (Personal Reflection)

1. **你是否離棄了起初的愛？** 以弗所教會有勞碌、有忍耐，卻失去了愛。你對基督的愛是否仍如起初火熱？

2. **你是不冷不熱嗎？** 老底嘉的問題不是太冷，而是自滿。你的屬靈生命是否在舒適區中變得麻木？

3. **基督在門外叩門** — 這驚人的圖畫：基督竟站在自己教會的門外！你有讓祂進入你生命的每一個領域嗎？

4. **你是得勝者嗎？** 每封信都以應許給「得勝的」結束。在今天的爭戰中，你靠基督得勝嗎？
