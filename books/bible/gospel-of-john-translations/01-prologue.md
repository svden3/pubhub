## The Prologue (1:1-18) 序言

### ESV (English Standard Version) - Red Letter

> ^1^In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. ^2^He was in the beginning with God. ^3^All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. ^4^In him was life, and the life was the light of men. ^5^The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

> ^6^There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. ^7^He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. ^8^He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.

> ^9^The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. ^10^He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. ^11^He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. ^12^But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, ^13^who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.

> ^14^And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. ^15^(John bore witness about him, and cried out, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.'") ^16^For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. ^17^For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. ^18^No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.

### NKJV (New King James Version)

> ^1^In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. ^2^He was in the beginning with God. ^3^All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. ^4^In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. ^5^And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.

> ^6^There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. ^7^This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe. ^8^He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.

> ^9^That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world. ^10^He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. ^11^He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. ^12^But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: ^13^who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

> ^14^And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. ^15^John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, "This was He of whom I said, 'He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.'" ^16^And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. ^17^For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. ^18^No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.

### NASB (New American Standard Bible 2020)

> ^1^In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. ^2^He was in the beginning with God. ^3^All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being. ^4^In Him was life, and the life was the Light of mankind. ^5^And the Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not grasp it.

> ^6^A man came, sent from God, whose name was John. ^7^He came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through him. ^8^He was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light.

> ^9^This was the true Light that, coming into the world, enlightens every person. ^10^He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, and yet the world did not know Him. ^11^He came to His own, and His own people did not accept Him. ^12^But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name, ^13^who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of a man, but of God.

> ^14^And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us; and we saw His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. ^15^John testified about Him and called out, saying, "This was He of whom I said, 'He who is coming after me has proved to be my superior, because He existed before me.'" ^16^For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace. ^17^For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ. ^18^No one has seen God at any time; God the only Son, who is in the arms of the Father, He has explained Him.

### NIV (New International Version 2011)

> ^1^In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. ^2^He was with God in the beginning. ^3^Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. ^4^In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. ^5^The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

> ^6^There was a man sent from God whose name was John. ^7^He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. ^8^He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.

> ^9^The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. ^10^He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. ^11^He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. ^12^Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— ^13^children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.

> ^14^The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. ^15^(John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, "This is the one I spoke about when I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'") ^16^Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given. ^17^For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. ^18^No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.

### CUV 和合本 (Chinese Union Version)

> ^1^太初有道，道與　神同在，道就是　神。^2^這道太初與　神同在。^3^萬物是藉著他造的；凡被造的，沒有一樣不是藉著他造的。^4^生命在他裏頭，這生命就是人的光。^5^光照在黑暗裏，黑暗卻不接受光。

> ^6^有一個人，是從　神那裏差來的，名叫約翰。^7^這人來，為要作見證，就是為光作見證，叫眾人因他可以信。^8^他不是那光，乃是要為光作見證。

> ^9^那光是真光，照亮一切生在世上的人。^10^他在世界，世界也是藉著他造的，世界卻不認識他。^11^他到自己的地方來，自己的人倒不接待他。^12^凡接待他的，就是信他名的人，他就賜他們權柄作　神的兒女。^13^這等人不是從血氣生的，不是從情慾生的，也不是從人意生的，乃是從　神生的。

> ^14^道成了肉身，住在我們中間，充充滿滿地有恩典有真理。我們也見過他的榮光，正是父獨生子的榮光。^15^約翰為他作見證，喊著說：「這就是我曾說：『那在我以後來的，反成了在我以前的，因他本來在我以前。』」^16^從他豐滿的恩典裏，我們都領受了，而且恩上加恩。^17^律法本是藉著摩西傳的；恩典和真理都是由耶穌基督來的。^18^從來沒有人看見　神，只有在父懷裏的獨生子將他表明出來。

## The Witness of John the Baptist (1:19-28)

### ESV - Red Letter

> ^19^And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?" ^20^He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ." ^21^And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" And he answered, "No." ^22^So they said to him, "Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?" ^23^He said, "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as the prophet Isaiah said."

> ^24^(Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.) ^25^They asked him, "Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?" ^26^John answered them, "I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know, ^27^even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie." ^28^These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

## The Lamb of God (1:29-34)

### ESV - Red Letter

> ^29^The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! ^30^This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.' ^31^I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel." ^32^And John bore witness: "I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. ^33^I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' ^34^And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."

## The First Disciples (1:35-51)

### ESV - Red Letter

> ^35^The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples, ^36^and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" ^37^The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. ^38^Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, \jesus{"What are you seeking?"} And they said to him, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?" ^39^He said to them, \jesus{"Come and you will see."} So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. ^40^One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. ^41^He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which means Christ). ^42^He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \jesus{"You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas"} (which means Peter).

> ^43^The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, \jesus{"Follow me."} ^44^Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. ^45^Philip found Nathanael and said to him, "We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." ^46^Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" Philip said to him, "Come and see." ^47^Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, \jesus{"Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!"} ^48^Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered him, \jesus{"Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."} ^49^Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!" ^50^Jesus answered him, \jesus{"Because I said to you, 'I saw you under the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these."} ^51^And he said to him, \jesus{"Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."}
