> \jesus{"Come and you will see."} (你們來看。)

**Deep meaning**: Christianity is not explained from afar, but **experienced by coming near**.

**1:43** - To Philip:
> \jesus{"Follow me."} (來跟從我。)

**Deep meaning**: Simple command, lifelong commitment - **following is the essence of discipleship**.

---

- **Spiritual birth** is essential, not optional
- **Human effort cannot achieve** what only Spirit can do

**Deep teaching**:

**4:13-14** - The promise:

**5:19-20** - Son's dependence on Father:
> \jesus{"Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing."}

**Deep teaching**:

- **Perfect obedience** - model for disciples
- **Love relationship** basis of ministry

**5:24** - From death to life:

**Deep teaching**:
- **Hearing + believing** = eternal life
- **Already passed** (perfect tense) - completed transaction

## 📖 Part II: Crisis & Commitment (Chapter 6)

### 7. Bread of Life Discourse (生命的糧) - John 6:25-71

**After feeding 5,000**, the crowd seeks Jesus. He teaches the deepest truth:

**6:26-27** - Don't work for perishing food:
> \jesus{"Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you."}

**6:35** - **FIRST "I AM"** statement:
> \jesus{"I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst."}

> \jesus{"All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out."}

> \jesus{"I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."}

> \jesus{「我是從天上降下來生命的糧；人若吃這糧，就必永遠活著。我所要賜的糧就是我的肉，為世人之生命所賜的。」}

**6:53-56** - Eating His flesh, drinking His blood:
> \jesus{"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink."}

- **Resurrection promise** - 4 times: "I will raise him up"

**6:67-69** - Peter's confession (after many left):
> Jesus said to the twelve, \jesus{"Do you want to go away as well?"}
> Peter answered, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God."

**Deep teaching for disciples**:
- **Crisis moment** - choose to follow or leave
- **No alternative** - only Jesus has eternal life
- **Revelation** - knowing Him is everything

## 📖 Part III: The "I AM" Declarations (Chapters 8-11)

### 8. Light of the World (世界的光) - John 8:12

**8:12** - **SECOND "I AM"**:
> \jesus{"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."}

> \jesus{「我是世界的光。跟從我的，就不在黑暗裏走，必要得著生命的光。」}

**Deep teaching**:
- **Following** = not walking in darkness
- **Light** = Jesus Himself, not just His teaching
- **Life-giving light** - not just information but transformation

**8:31-32** - True discipleship:
> Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, \jesus{"If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."}

> \jesus{「你們若常常遵守我的道，就真是我的門徒；你們必曉得真理，真理必叫你們得以自由。」}

**Deep teaching**:

- **True disciples** - defined by perseverance
- **Truth sets free** - from sin, death, deception

**8:58** - Before Abraham:
> \jesus{"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM."}

**Deepest claim**:

> \jesus{"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."}

> \jesus{「盜賊來，無非要偷竊，殺害，毀壞；我來了，是要叫羊（或作：人）得生命，並且得的更豐盛。」}

**10:11** - **FOURTH "I AM"**:
> \jesus{"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep."}

> \jesus{「我是好牧人；好牧人為羊捨命。」}

**10:14-15** - Knowing His sheep:
> \jesus{"I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep."}

**10:27-30** - **ETERNAL SECURITY**:
> \jesus{"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. I and the Father are one."}

> \jesus{「我的羊聽我的聲音，我也認識他們，他們也跟著我。我又賜給他們永生；他們永不滅亡，誰也不能從我手裏把他們奪去。我父把羊賜給我，他比萬有都大，誰也不能從我父手裏把他們奪去。我與父原為一。」}

**Deepest comfort for disciples**:
- **Hear → Know → Follow** - pattern of discipleship
- **Eternal life given** - present possession
- **Never perish** - absolute promise
- **Double security** - in Jesus's hand AND Father's hand
- **Unity with Father** - ultimate security

---

### 10. Resurrection and Life (復活與生命) - John 11:25-26

**Before raising Lazarus**, Jesus teaches Martha (and disciples watching):

**11:25-26** - **FIFTH "I AM"**:
> \jesus{"I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?"}

> \jesus{「復活在我，生命也在我。信我的人雖然死了，也必復活，凡活著信我的人必永遠不死。你信這話嗎？」}

**Deepest truth**:
- **Present reality** - "I AM" (not "I will be")
- **Physical death conquered** - "though he die, yet shall he live"
- **Eternal life secured** - "shall never die"
- **Personal question** - "Do YOU believe?"

---

## 📖 Part IV: UPPER ROOM DISCOURSE (最寶貴的教導)

**Chapters 13-17: The Heart of Jesus Revealed**

These five chapters contain **Jesus's longest private teaching to His disciples**.
**The night before the cross** - His most precious words.

---

### 11. Washing Feet - Love & Service (洗腳) - John 13

**13:1** - Context:
> "Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end."
> 「他既然愛世間屬自己的人，就愛他們到底。」

**13:8** - Peter's resistance:
> Peter said, "You shall never wash my feet."
> Jesus answered, \jesus{"If I do not wash you, you have no share with me."}

**Deep teaching**:
- **Humility** - God washing human feet
- **Service** - greatest must be servant
- **Cleansing** - spiritual washing necessary

**13:13-17** - Call to imitate:
> \jesus{"You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you. Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them."}

**13:34-35** - **THE NEW COMMANDMENT**:
> \jesus{"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."}

> \jesus{「我賜給你們一條新命令，乃是叫你們彼此相愛；我怎樣愛你們，你們也要怎樣相愛。你們若有彼此相愛的心，眾人因此就認出你們是我的門徒了。」}

**The mark of discipleship**:
- Not miracles
- Not knowledge
- Not spiritual gifts
- **LOVE for one another**

---

### 12. Way, Truth, Life (道路真理生命) - John 14

**14:1-4** - Do not let hearts be troubled:
> \jesus{"Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also. And you know the way to where I am going."}

**14:6** - **SIXTH "I AM"** - **Most quoted verse**:
> \jesus{"I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."}

> \jesus{「我就是道路、真理、生命；若不藉著我，沒有人能到父那裏去。」}

**Exclusive claim**:
- **THE way** (not "a" way) - only path to Father
- **THE truth** - absolute reality
- **THE life** - source of all spiritual life
- **No one** - universal exclusivity
- **Except through me** - Christ alone

**14:9** - Seeing the Father:
> \jesus{"Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?"}

**14:12** - Greater works:
> \jesus{"Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father."}

**14:13-14** - Prayer in His name:
> \jesus{"Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it."}

**14:15** - Love shown by obedience:
> \jesus{"If you love me, you will keep my commandments."}

> \jesus{「你們若愛我，就必遵守我的命令。」}

**14:16-17** - **THE HOLY SPIRIT PROMISED**:
> \jesus{"And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you."}

> \jesus{「我要求父，父就另外賜給你們一位保惠師（或作：訓慰師；下同），叫他永遠與你們同在，就是真理的聖靈，乃世人不能接受的；因為不見他，也不認識他。你們卻認識他，因他常與你們同在，也要在你們裏面。」}

**Comfort for disciples**:
- **Another** (ἄλλος) - same kind, not different
- **Helper/Comforter** (Παράκλητος) - one called alongside
- **Forever** - permanent presence
- **In you** - internal, intimate

**14:18** - Not orphans:
> \jesus{"I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you."}

**14:21** - Love and obedience:
> \jesus{"Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him."}

**14:23** - The Father's indwelling:
> \jesus{"If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him."}

> \jesus{「人若愛我，就必遵守我的道；我父也必愛他，並且我們要到他那裏去，與他同住。」}

**Trinity indwelling believers**:
- Father + Son make home in believer
- Conditioned on love → obedience
- Greatest privilege!

**14:26** - **HOLY SPIRIT'S TEACHING MINISTRY**:
> \jesus{"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you."}

**14:27** - **THE GIFT OF PEACE**:
> \jesus{"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid."}

> \jesus{「我留下平安給你們；我將我的平安賜給你們。我所賜的，不像世人所賜的。你們心裏不要憂愁，也不要膽怯。」}

**Jesus's peace**:
- His **personal** peace
- Not **worldly** peace (temporary, circumstantial)
- **Inner** peace despite outer storms

### 13. True Vine (真葡萄樹) - John 15

**15:1** - **SEVENTH "I AM"**:
> \jesus{"I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser."}

> \jesus{「我是真葡萄樹，我父是栽培的人。」}

**15:2** - Pruning for fruitfulness:
> \jesus{"Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit."}

**15:4-5** - **ABIDE IN ME**:
> \jesus{"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing."}

> \jesus{「你們要常在我裏面，我也常在你們裏面。枝子若不常在葡萄樹上，自己就不能結果子；你們若不常在我裏面，也是這樣。我是葡萄樹，你們是枝子。常在我裏面的，我也常在他裏面，這人就多結果子；因為離了我，你們就不能做甚麼。」}

**Critical teaching**:
- **Abide** (μένω) - 11 times in chapter 15!
- **Apart from me = NOTHING** - total dependence
- **Fruit comes from abiding** - not striving
- **Branches derive all from vine** - position, not performance

**15:7** - Answered prayer:
> \jesus{"If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."}

**15:9-11** - **ABIDE IN LOVE**:
> \jesus{"As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full."}

**Chain of love**:
Father → Son → Disciples
Pattern: Love → Obey → Abide → Joy

**15:12-13** - Greatest love:
> \jesus{"This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends."}

> \jesus{「你們要彼此相愛，像我愛你們一樣；這就是我的命令。人為朋友捨命，人的愛心沒有比這個大的。」}

**15:14-15** - From servants to friends:
> \jesus{"You are my friends if you do what I command you. No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you."}

**Intimacy with Jesus**:
- Not servants - **FRIENDS**
- Know Father's business
- Share in divine counsel

**15:16** - Chosen and appointed:
> \jesus{"You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you."}

> \jesus{「不是你們揀選了我，是我揀選了你們，並且分派你們去結果子，叫你們的果子常存，使你們奉我的名，無論向父求甚麼，他就賜給你們。」}

**Election truth**:
- **He chose** - sovereign grace
- **Appointed** - divine calling
- **Fruit that abides** - lasting impact
- **Prayer power** - name of Jesus

**15:17** - Love one another:
> \jesus{"These things I command you, so that you will love one another."}

---

### 14. Holy Spirit's Work (聖靈的工作) - John 16

**16:7** - Advantage of Spirit:
> \jesus{"Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you."}

> \jesus{「然而，我將真情告訴你們，我去是與你們有益的；我若不去，保惠師就不到你們這裏來；我若去，就差他來。」}

**Why Spirit is better**:
- Jesus limited by body → Spirit omnipresent
- Jesus with them → Spirit in them
- Jesus temporary → Spirit eternal

**16:8-11** - **SPIRIT'S THREEFOLD WORK**:
> \jesus{"And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged."}

**Conviction of**:
1. **Sin** - unbelief is root sin
2. **Righteousness** - Jesus's vindication at right hand
3. **Judgment** - Satan defeated at cross

**16:13-15** - **SPIRIT OF TRUTH**:
> \jesus{"When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you."}

**Spirit's ministry**:
- **Guide into truth** - progressive revelation
- **Not independent** - speaks what he hears
- **Glorifies Jesus** - points to Christ
- **Declares Father's things** - Trinity unity

**16:20-22** - Sorrow to joy:
> \jesus{"Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy. When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come, but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world. So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you."}

**Pattern**: Cross → Resurrection → Joy
Like childbirth: Pain → New life → Permanent joy

**16:23-24** - Ask in His name:
> \jesus{"In that day you will ask nothing of me. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full."}

**16:27** - Father's love:
> \jesus{"for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God."}

**16:33** - **FINAL ENCOURAGEMENT**:
> \jesus{"I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world."}

> \jesus{「我將這些事告訴你們，是要叫你們在我裏面有平安。在世上，你們有苦難；但你們可以放心，我已經勝了世界。」}

**Last word before prayer**:
- **Peace in Him** - location of peace
- **Tribulation certain** - realistic expectation
- **Take heart** - courage command
- **Already overcome** - perfect tense, finished victory

**17:1-5** - Prayer for His glorification:
> \jesus{"Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you, since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do.

**17:13** - Full joy:
